	<h1>My first Black Board Day</h1>

	
      <p> Saturday, I participated in my first <a href="https://memming.wordpress.com/category/event/bbd-event/" target="_blank">Black Board Day</a>, an informal annual workshop dedicated to Gödel and organized for the past ten years by the neuroscientist <a href="https://memming.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Memming Park</a> and his enthusiastic group of scientist friends. <!--more-->
Every year around the time of Gödel's birthday (April 28), they gather for a day of talks and discussions on topics in my research field: mathematical logic. According to workshop rules, all talks must be given, as the namesake suggests, the old fashioned way. (On a side note, we should really consider adopting this policy for the <a href="" target="_blank">set theory seminar</a> as well.) I first learned about BBDay last year, when I followed a link from a pingback on my blog and saw Memming's post on BBDay 9 held at the University of Texas at Austen. I was super excited to find a bunch of scientists, not even all mathematicians, who like me thought that mathematical logic is very cool. So I left a comment to that effect. Meanwhile, Memming moved to Stonybrook University and BBDay moved with him to New York. This year it was held at Columbia University and I got to tell a very excited group of scientists about nonstandard models of the Peano axioms.</p>

<p>This was an abridged version of the <a href="/talks/2015/04/22/an-introduction-to-nonstandard-models-of-arithmetic/" target="_blank">talk</a> I recently gave at VCU (but on black board, of course). </p>

<p>It was a lively day of talks, discussions, and arguments, both mathematical and philosophical, which started out in the classroom and then moved outdoors to partake in the beautiful spring weather.<p>

<p>We talked about the incompleteness theorems, nonstandard models of ${\rm PA}$, Goodstein sequences, the axiom of choice, paradoxes in probability, and much much more! Just as the discussions were wrapping up, we were joined by an unlikely visitor. </p>
