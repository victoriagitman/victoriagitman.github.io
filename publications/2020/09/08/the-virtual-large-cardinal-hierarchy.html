<p>The study of generic large cardinals, being cardinals that are critical points of elementary embeddings existing in generic extensions, goes back to the 1970's. At that time, the primary interest was the existence of <em>precipitous</em> and <em>saturated</em> ideals on small cardinals like $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. Research in this area later moved to the study of more general generic embeddings, both defined on $V$, but also on rank-initial segments of $V$ - these were investigated by e.g. <a href="#DonderLevinski:OnWeaklyPrecipitousFilters">[1]</a> and <a href="#FerberGitik:OnAlmostPrecipitousIdeals">[2]</a>.</p>

These large cardinals are special because they allow us to work with embeddings as in the higher reaches of the large cardinal hierarchy while being consistent with $V=L$, which enables equiconsistencies at these "lower levels".</p>

<p>To take a few examples, <a href="#schindler:remarkable1">[3]</a> has shown that the existence of a remarkable cardinal is equiconsistent with the statement that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ cannot be changed by proper forcing, which was improved to semi-proper forcing in <a href="#schindler:remarkable2">[5]</a>. <a href="#Wilson:VopenkaCardinalsZFSuslinSets">[6]</a> has shown that the existence of a virtually Vopěnka cardinal is equiconsistent with the hypothesis

<p>Kunen's Inconsistency fails for virtual large cardinals in the sense that a forcing extension can have elementary embeddings $j:V_\alpha^V\to V_\alpha^V$ with $\alpha$ much larger than the supremum of the critical sequence. In the theory of large cardinals, Kunen's Inconsistency is for instance used to prove that requiring that $j(\kappa)>\lambda$ in the definition of $\kappa$ being $\lambda$-strong is superfluous.
