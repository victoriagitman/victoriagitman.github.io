<p>The compactness of strong logics and set theory have been intertwined since Tarski <a href="#Tarski:compactness">[1]</a> defined (weakly and strongly) compact cardinals in terms of the properties of the infinitary logic $\mathbb L_{\kappa, \omega}$. This established a strong connection between abstract model theory and the theory of large cardinals, which has also become apparent by the recent breakthroughs in the theory of Abstract Elementary Classes-a purely model theoretic framework-where certain important results depend on the existence of large cardinal axioms.</p>

<p>The interaction between the two fields is also strengthened by the first author's article <a href="#Boney:ModelTheoreticCharacterizationsOfLargeCardinals">[2]</a>, which establishes new characterizations of established large cardinal notions, expressed in model theoretic terms as compactness properties. This paper is a sequel to <a href="#Boney:ModelTheoreticCharacterizationsOfLargeCardinals">[2]</a> and characterizes more large cardinals this way, namely Woodin, various virtual large cardinals and subtle cardinals. Notably, this has led us to generalise or define new concepts in abstract model theory, that may be useful outside the scope of the current exposition. </p>
