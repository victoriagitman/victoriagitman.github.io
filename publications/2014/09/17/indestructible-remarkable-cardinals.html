A decade after Laver&#39;s result, Gitik and Shelah showed that strong cardinals can be made indestructible by all weakly $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing with the Prikry property {% cite GitikShelah:IndestructibleStrongCardinals %} (see this post), a class that includes all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and Woodin showed, using his technique of surgery, that they can be made indestructible by forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. More recently, Hamkins and Johnstone showed that strongly unfoldable cardinals can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\kappa^+$-preserving forcing {% cite hamkinsjohnstone:unfoldable %}. It turns out that not all large cardinals possess robust indestructibility properties. Very recently, Bagaria et al. showed that a number of large cardinal notions including superstrong, huge, and rank-into-rank cardinals are superdestructible: they cannot even be indestructible by ${\rm Add}(\kappa,1)$ {% cite BagariaHamkinsTsaprounisUsuba:SuperstrongAndOtherLargeCardinalsAreNeverLaverIndestructible %}. In this article, we show that remarkable cardinals have indestructibility properties resembling those of strong cardinals. They can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive. Theorem: If $\kappa$ is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which the remarkability of $\kappa$ is becomes indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive. In particular, a remarkable $\kappa$ can be made indestructible by all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and since $\dot {\mathbb R}$ can be trivial, by all forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. One application of the main theorem is that any ${\rm GCH}$ pattern can be forced above a remarkable cardinal. Another application uses a recent forcing construction of Cheng, Hamkins, and Friedman {% cite ChengFriedmanHamkins:LargeCardinalsNeedNotBeLargeInHOD %}, to produce a remarkable cardinal that is not remarkable in ${\rm HOD}$. Using techniques from the proof the main theorem, we also show that remarkability is preserved by the canonical forcing of the ${\rm GCH}$. For the indestructibility arguments, we define the notion of a remarkable Laver function and show that every remarkable cardinal carries such a function. Although Laver-like functions can be forced to exist for many large cardinal notions {% cite Hamkins:LaverDiamond %}, remarkable cardinals along with supercompact and strong cardinals are some of the few that outright possess such fully set-anticipating functions. For instance, not every strongly unfoldable cardinal has a Laver-like function because it is consistent that $\diamondsuit_\kappa({\rm REG})$ fails at a strongly unfoldable cardinal {% cite DzamonjaHamkins2006:DiamondCanFail %}. Definition: A cardinal $\kappa$ is remarkable if in the ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ forcing extension $V[G]$, for every regular cardinal $\lambda&gt;\kappa$, there is a $V$-regular cardinal $\overline\lambda&lt;\kappa$ and $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ with critical point $\gamma$ such that $j(\gamma)=\kappa$. Schindler originally used a different primary characterization of remarkable cardinals, but he has recently switched to using the above characterization, which gives remarkable cardinals a character of generic supercompactness {% cite schindler:remarkable %}. Magidor showed that $\kappa$ is supercompact if and only if for every regular cardinal $\lambda&gt;\kappa$, there is a regular cardinal $\overline \lambda&lt;\kappa$ and $j:H_{\overline\lambda}\to H_\lambda$ with critical point $\gamma$ such $j(\gamma)=\kappa$ {% cite magidor:supercompact %}. Schindler introduced remarkable cardinals when he isolated them as the large cardinal notion whose existence is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ cannot be altered by proper forcing. The assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ is absolute for all set forcing is intimately connected with ${\rm AD}^{L(\mathbb R)}$ and its consistency strength lies in the neighborhood of infinitely many Woodin cardinals {% cite schindler:remarkable1 %}. In contrast, remarkable cardinals are much weaker than measurable cardinals, and indeed they can exist in $L$. Consistency-wise, they fit tightly into the $\alpha$-iterable hierarchy of large cardinal notions (below a Ramsey cardinal) introduced by Gitman and Welch {% cite gitman:welch %}, where they lie above 1-iterable, but below 2-iterable cardinals, placing them above hierarchies of ineffability, but much below an $\omega$-Erdős cardinal. Remarkable cardinals are also totally indescribable and $\Sigma_2$-reflecting. Strong cardinals are remarkable, but the least measurable cardinal cannot be remarkable by $\Sigma_2$-reflection.

<p>Since the seminal results of Levy and Solovay <a href="#levysolovay:ch">[1]</a> on the indestructibility of large cardinals by small forcing and Laver on the making a supercompact cardinal indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-directed closed forcing <a href="#laver:supercompact">[2]</a>, indestructibility properties of various large cardinal notions have been intensively studied. A decade after Laver's result, Gitik and Shelah showed that strong cardinals can be made indestructible by all weakly $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing with the Prikry property <a href="#GitikShelah:IndestructibleStrongCardinals">[3]</a> (see this <a href="/publications/2009/10/28/making-strong-cardinals-indestructible-by-leqkappa-weakly-closed-prikry-forcing.html">post</a>), a class that includes all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and Woodin showed, using his technique of surgery, that they can be made indestructible by forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. More recently, Hamkins and Johnstone showed that strongly unfoldable cardinals can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\kappa^+$-preserving forcing <a href="#hamkinsjohnstone:unfoldable">[4]</a>. It turns out that not all large cardinals possess robust indestructibility properties. Very recently, Bagaria et al. showed that a number of large cardinal notions including superstrong, huge, and rank-into-rank cardinals are superdestructible: they cannot even be indestructible by ${\rm Add}(\kappa,1)$ <a href="#BagariaHamkinsTsaprounisUsuba:SuperstrongAndOtherLargeCardinalsAreNeverLaverIndestructible">[5]</a>. In this article, we show that remarkable cardinals have indestructibility properties resembling those of strong cardinals. They can be made indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: If $\kappa$ is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which the remarkability of $\kappa$ is becomes indestructible by all $\lt\kappa$-closed $\leq\kappa$-distributive forcing and by all two-step iterations ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)*\dot{\mathbb R}$, where $\dot{\mathbb R}$ is forced to be $\lt\kappa$-closed and $\leq\kappa$-distributive.</p>

<p>In particular, a remarkable $\kappa$ can be made indestructible by all $\leq\kappa$-closed forcing, and since $\dot {\mathbb R}$ can be trivial, by all forcing of the form ${\rm Add}(\kappa,\theta)$. One application of the main theorem is that any ${\rm GCH}$ pattern can be forced above a remarkable cardinal. Another application uses a recent forcing construction of Cheng, Hamkins, and Friedman <a href="#ChengFriedmanHamkins:LargeCardinalsNeedNotBeLargeInHOD">[6]</a>, to produce a remarkable cardinal that is not remarkable in ${\rm HOD}$. Using techniques from the proof the main theorem, we also show that remarkability is preserved by the canonical forcing of the ${\rm GCH}$.</p>

<p>For the indestructibility arguments, we define the notion of a <em>remarkable Laver function</em> and show that every remarkable cardinal carries such a function. Although Laver-like functions can be forced to exist for many large cardinal notions <a href="#Hamkins:LaverDiamond">[7]</a>, remarkable cardinals along with supercompact and strong cardinals are some of the few that outright possess such fully set-anticipating functions. For instance, not every strongly unfoldable cardinal has a Laver-like function because it is consistent that $\diamondsuit_\kappa({\rm REG})$ fails at a strongly unfoldable cardinal <a href="#DzamonjaHamkins2006:DiamondCanFail">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>remarkable</em> if in the ${\rm Coll}(\omega,\lt\kappa)$ forcing extension $V[G]$, for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a $V$-regular cardinal $\overline\lambda<\kappa$ and $j:H_{\overline\lambda}^V\to H_\lambda^V$ with critical point $\gamma$ such that $j(\gamma)=\kappa$.</p>

<p>Schindler originally used a different primary characterization of remarkable cardinals, but he has recently switched to using the above characterization, which gives remarkable cardinals a character of generic supercompactness <a href="#schindler:remarkable">[9]</a>. Magidor showed that $\kappa$ is supercompact if and only if for every regular cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$, there is a regular cardinal $\overline \lambda<\kappa$ and  $j:H_{\overline\lambda}\to H_\lambda$ with critical point $\gamma$ such $j(\gamma)=\kappa$ <a href="#magidor:supercompact">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>Schindler introduced remarkable cardinals when he isolated them as the large cardinal notion whose existence is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ cannot be altered by proper forcing. The assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ is absolute for all set forcing is intimately connected with ${\rm AD}^{L(\mathbb R)}$ and its consistency strength lies in the neighborhood of infinitely many Woodin cardinals <a href="#schindler:remarkable1">[11]</a>. In contrast, remarkable cardinals are much weaker than measurable cardinals, and indeed they can exist in $L$. Consistency-wise, they fit tightly into the $\alpha$-iterable hierarchy of large cardinal notions (below a Ramsey cardinal) introduced by Gitman and Welch <a href="#gitman:welch">[12]</a>, where they lie above 1-iterable, but below 2-iterable cardinals, placing them above hierarchies of ineffability, but much below an $\omega$-Erdős cardinal. Remarkable cardinals are also totally indescribable and $\Sigma_2$-reflecting. Strong cardinals are remarkable, but the least measurable cardinal cannot be remarkable  by $\Sigma_2$-reflection.
