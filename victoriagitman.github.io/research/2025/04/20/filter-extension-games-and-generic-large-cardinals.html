<meta name="description" content="A cardinal $\kappa$ is called generically blah, where blah stands in for some large cardinal notion if $\kappa$ has some property characterizing the blah large cardinal in a forcing extension. So, for instance, a cardinal $\kappa$ is generically measurable if in a forcing extension there is an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive and $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, but $M$ not necessarily contained in $V$. Equivalently, $\kappa$ is generically measurable if some forcing extension has a $V$-ultrafilter - a filter measuring $P(\kappa)^V$ that is $V$-$\kappa$-complete and $V$-normal, with a well-founded ultrapower. For the reader familiar with the previous post, this is precisely how we defined the notion of the external $M$-ultrafilter for a weak $\kappa$-model $M$. The reader of the previous post will also have noticed that for external ultrafilters, such as $M$-ultrafilters, the property of weak amenability turns out to be quite important. So what if we further require that the $V$-ultrafilter in the forcing extension is weakly amenable? This cannot be equivalent to generic measurability because $\omega_1$ can be generically measurable, if say $\omega_1$ carries a precipitous uniform normal ideal, but if a forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter, then $\kappa$ is at least weakly compact and more (follows from {% cite GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy %}). What if we ask that the weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter have well-founded iterated ultrapowers? Of course, all these notions are equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal because generic measurability is already equiconsistent with it {% cite jech:settheory %}. So let&#39;s look at some natural weakenings of generic measurability. What if we ask that in a forcing extension, for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, there is an $H_\theta$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower? And what if we additionally ask that the $H_\theta$-ultrafilters are weakly amenable? We can also weaken generic measurability in a different direction by dropping the requirement that the $V$-ultrafilter produces a well-founded ultrapower, but maybe keeping weak amenability? Maybe even consider weak $V$-ultrafilters, where we drop the $V$-normality requirement? We can also go off in an entirely different direction and care about which poset provides the forcing extension with the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter. Maybe we want the forcing extension to be by a poset of the form $P(\kappa)/I$ for a uniform normal ideal $I$ on $\kappa$. Or maybe we want the forcing to be $\gamma$-closed for some cardinal $\gamma$? Assuming that a forcing extension has a $V$-ultrafilter has no large cardinal strength. If $\kappa$ is uncountable and regular, then the non-stationary ideal $NS_\kappa$ is normal, and so forcing with $P(\kappa)/NS_\kappa$ adds a $V$-ultrafilter. Conversely, if a forcing extension has a $V$-ultrafilter, then the ultrapower map $j:V\to M$, with $M$ potentially ill-founded, nontheless has critical point $\kappa$, which can be used to show that $\kappa$ is regular. But adding in weak amenability will give large cardinal strength. It actually turns out that several of these variations on generic measurability are characterized by the existence of a winning strategy for the judge in the filter extension games discussed in the previous post. We will assume throughout that $\kappa$ is inaccessible. First, let&#39;s give formal definitions of some generic large cardinal notions. We will call a weak $V$-ultrafilter good if it produces a well-founded ultrapower. Definition: $\kappa$ is weakly almost generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable weak $V$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has a good $H_\theta$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $H_\theta$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter.&lt;/em&gt; $\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) and $\alpha$-iterability if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter with $\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers. $\kappa$ is (any of the above notions) by $\mathcal P$ (a class of forcings) if the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter exists in a forcing extension by some $\mathbb P\in\mathcal P$. &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Here is what we know about the strength of these notions. $\kappa$ weakly almost generically measurable with wa if and only if it is weakly compact (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). $\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with wa if and only if it is completely ineffable (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). Generically measurable for sets cardinals can exists in $L$, but are stronger than completely ineffables (follows from {% cite GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy %}). Generically measurable for sets cardinals are equiconsistent with generically measurable with wa for sets cardinals (follows from {% cite GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy %}). Notice here that it is possible to have good generic $H_\theta$-ultrafilters, for all sufficiently large $\theta$, but not a good generic $V$-ultrafilter (because this is much higher in consistency strength). We will abbreviate the assertion that the judge has a winning strategy a filter game $G$ by $\text{Judge}_G$. $\kappa$ is weakly almost generically measurable (weakly compact) if and only if $\text{Judge}_{G_1(\kappa)}$. $\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with wa (completely ineffable) if and only if $\text{Judge}_{wG_\omega(\kappa)}$ (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). If $\text{Judge}_{G_\omega(\kappa,\theta)}$ for every regular $\theta&gt;\kappa$, then $\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets with wa (by $\text{Coll}(\omega,H_\theta)$) (follows from {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}). $\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets with wa is equiconsistent with $\text{Judge}_{G_\omega(\kappa,\theta)}$ for every regular $\theta&gt;\kappa$ (follows from {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}). If $\text{Judge}_{sG_\omega(\kappa)}$, then $\kappa$ is generically measurable with wa and $\omega_1$-iterability (by $\text{Coll}(\omega,H_{\lambda^+})$) (analogous to {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}). Suppose $2^\kappa=\kappa^+$. If $\text{Judge}_{sG_\omega(\kappa)}$, then $\kappa $ is generically measurable with wa by $P(\kappa)/I$ for a precipitous uniform normal ideal $I$ (follows from {% cite MagForZem %}). For uncountable regular cardinals $\delta$, $\text{Judge}_{G_\delta(\kappa)}$ if and only if $\kappa$ is generically measurable with wa by $\delta$-closed forcing (analogous to {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}). Question: Can we construct a generic weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter not all of whose iterated ultrapowers are well-founded? Let&#39;s move on now to generic supercompactness. In the setting of supercompactness, a $V$-ultrafilter is going to be a filter measuring $P(P_\kappa(\lambda))^V$ that is fine, $V$-$\kappa$-complete and $V$-normal. Without the $V$-normality assumption, we will say that the $V$-ultrafilter is weak. If the ultrapower is well-founded, we will say that it is good. A cardinal $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, and $j&#39;&#39;\lambda\in M$. Equivalently, $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact if some forcing extension has a good $V$-ultrafilter. A cardinal $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-strongly compact if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, and $j&#39;&#39;\lambda\subseteq s$ with $|s|^M\lt j(\kappa)$. Equivalently, some forcing extension has a good weak $V$-ultrafilter. Now we can introduce all the same variations of partial generic supercompactness that we discussed above for generic measurability with many results generalizing, but also in this case a number of open questions. We can define the notions of stationary, unbounded, and closed for subsets of $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ and show that the non-stationary ideal is fine and normal (see for, instance, {% cite jech:settheory %}). This shows that the existence of a $V$-ultrafilter does not carry large cardinal strength. Here are the generic large cardinal notions corresponding to the ones we considered for generic measurability. $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-strongly compact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable weak $V$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has an $H_\theta$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower. $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $H_\theta$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter. $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) and $\alpha$-iterability if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter with $\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers. $\kappa$ is (any of the above notions) by $\mathcal P$ (a class of forcings) if the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter exists in a forcing extension by some $\mathbb P\in\mathcal P$. For what follows, we assume that $\lambda^{\lt\kappa}=\lambda$. Here is what we know about the strength of these notions {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}. See previous post for definitions of nearly $\lambda$-strongly and supercompact cardinals. $\kappa$ almost generically $\lambda$-strong with wa if and only if it is nearly $\lambda$-strongly compact. $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa if and only if it is completely $\lambda$-ineffable. The least $\kappa$ for which there is some $\lambda$ such that $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa is not generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa for sets. Question: Do nearly $\lambda$-supercompact cardinals have a generic large cardinal characterization? Question: Are generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals equiconsistent with generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals with wa? For the corresponding generic measurability notions, it was shown that generically measurable for sets cardinals are generically measurable with wa for sets in $L$ {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}, but of course at this large cardinal level canonical models are not available. Question: Can we separate the following notions via equivalence or equiconsistency: generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets with wa generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa and $\omega_1$-iterability ($\alpha$-iterability for some $\alpha&gt;1$) generically $\lambda$-supercompact As with versions of generic measurability, several of the partial generic supercompacts are characterized by the existence of a winning strategy for the judge in one of the filter extension games on mini-supercompactness measures discussed in the previous post {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}. $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-strongly compact (nearly $\lambda$-strongly compact) if and only if: $\text{Judge}_{G_1(\kappa,\lambda)}$ $\text{Judge}_{wG^*_\omega(\kappa,\lambda)}$ $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa (completely $\lambda$-ineffable) if and only if $\text{Judge}_{wG_\omega(\kappa,\lambda)}$. If $\text{Judge}_{G_\omega(\kappa,\lambda,\theta)}$ for every regular $\theta&gt;\lambda$, then $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets with wa (by $\text{Coll}(\omega,H_\theta)$). If $\text{Judge}_{sG_\omega(\kappa,\lambda)}$, then $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa and $\omega_1$-iterability (by $\text{Coll}(\omega,H_{\lambda^+})$). Suppose $2^\lambda=\lambda^+$. If $\text{Judge}_{sG_\omega(\kappa,\lambda)}$, then $\kappa $ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact by $P(\kappa)/I$ for a precipitious normal fine ideal $I$. For uncountable regular cardinals $\delta$, $\text{Judge}_{G_\delta(\kappa,\lambda)}$ if and only if $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa by $\delta$-closed forcing.

Definition: $\\kappa$ is weakly almost generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable weak $V$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\\theta$, some forcing extension has a good $H_\\theta$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\\theta$, some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $H_\\theta$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter.&lt;/em&gt; $\\kappa$ is generically measurable with weak amenability (wa) and $\\alpha$-iterability if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter with $\\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers. $\\kappa$ is (any of the above notions) by $\\mathcal P$ (a class of forcings) if the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter exists in a forcing extension by some $\\mathbb P\\in\\mathcal P$. &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Here is what we know about the strength of these notions. $\\kappa$ weakly almost generically measurable with wa if and only if it is weakly compact (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). $\\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with wa if and only if it is completely ineffable (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). Generically measurable for sets cardinals can exists in $L$, but are stronger than completely ineffables (follows from {% cite GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy %}). Generically measurable for sets cardinals are equiconsistent with generically measurable with wa for sets cardinals (follows from {% cite GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy %}). Notice here that it is possible to have good generic $H_\\theta$-ultrafilters, for all sufficiently large $\\theta$, but not a good generic $V$-ultrafilter (because this is much higher in consistency strength). We will abbreviate the assertion that the judge has a winning strategy a filter game $G$ by $\\text{Judge}_G$. $\\kappa$ is weakly almost generically measurable (weakly compact) if and only if $\\text{Judge}_{G_1(\\kappa)}$. $\\kappa$ is almost generically measurable with wa (completely ineffable) if and only if $\\text{Judge}_{wG_\\omega(\\kappa)}$ (follows from {% cite AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties %}). If $\\text{Judge}_{G_\\omega(\\kappa,\\theta)}$ for every regular $\\theta&gt;\\kappa$, then $\\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets with wa (by $\\text{Coll}(\\omega,H_\\theta)$) (follows from {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}). $\\kappa$ is generically measurable for sets with wa is equiconsistent with $\\text{Judge}_{G_\\omega(\\kappa,\\theta)}$ for every regular $\\theta&gt;\\kappa$ (follows from {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}). If $\\text{Judge}_{sG_\\omega(\\kappa)}$, then $\\kappa$ is generically measurable with wa and $\\omega_1$-iterability (by $\\text{Coll}(\\omega,H_{\\lambda^+})$) (analogous to {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}). Suppose $2^\\kappa=\\kappa^+$. If $\\text{Judge}_{sG_\\omega(\\kappa)}$, then $\\kappa $ is generically measurable with wa by $P(\\kappa)/I$ for a precipitous uniform normal ideal $I$ (follows from {% cite MagForZem %}). For uncountable regular cardinals $\\delta$, $\\text{Judge}_{G_\\delta(\\kappa)}$ if and only if $\\kappa$ is generically measurable with wa by $\\delta$-closed forcing (analogous to {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}). Question: Can we construct a generic weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter not all of whose iterated ultrapowers are well-founded? Let&#39;s move on now to generic supercompactness. In the setting of supercompactness, a $V$-ultrafilter is going to be a filter measuring $P(P_\\kappa(\\lambda))^V$ that is fine, $V$-$\\kappa$-complete and $V$-normal. Without the $V$-normality assumption, we will say that the $V$-ultrafilter is weak. If the ultrapower is well-founded, we will say that it is good. A cardinal $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\\text{crit}(j)=\\kappa$, and $j&#39;&#39;\\lambda\\in M$. Equivalently, $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact if some forcing extension has a good $V$-ultrafilter. A cardinal $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-strongly compact if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\\text{crit}(j)=\\kappa$, and $j&#39;&#39;\\lambda\\subseteq s$ with $|s|^M\\lt j(\\kappa)$. Equivalently, some forcing extension has a good weak $V$-ultrafilter. Now we can introduce all the same variations of partial generic supercompactness that we discussed above for generic measurability with many results generalizing, but also in this case a number of open questions. We can define the notions of stationary, unbounded, and closed for subsets of $P_\\kappa(\\lambda)$ and show that the non-stationary ideal is fine and normal (see for, instance, {% cite jech:settheory %}). This shows that the existence of a $V$-ultrafilter does not carry large cardinal strength. Here are the generic large cardinal notions corresponding to the ones we considered for generic measurability. $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-strongly compact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable weak $V$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\\theta$, some forcing extension has an $H_\\theta$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower. $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) for sets if for all sufficiently large regular $\\theta$, some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $H_\\theta$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter. $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa) and $\\alpha$-iterability if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter with $\\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers. $\\kappa$ is (any of the above notions) by $\\mathcal P$ (a class of forcings) if the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter exists in a forcing extension by some $\\mathbb P\\in\\mathcal P$. For what follows, we assume that $\\lambda^{\\lt\\kappa}=\\lambda$. Here is what we know about the strength of these notions {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}. See previous post for definitions of nearly $\\lambda$-strongly and supercompact cardinals. $\\kappa$ almost generically $\\lambda$-strong with wa if and only if it is nearly $\\lambda$-strongly compact. $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa if and only if it is completely $\\lambda$-ineffable. The least $\\kappa$ for which there is some $\\lambda$ such that $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa is not generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa for sets. Question: Do nearly $\\lambda$-supercompact cardinals have a generic large cardinal characterization? Question: Are generically $\\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals equiconsistent with generically $\\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals with wa? For the corresponding generic measurability notions, it was shown that generically measurable for sets cardinals are generically measurable with wa for sets in $L$ {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}, but of course at this large cardinal level canonical models are not available. Question: Can we separate the following notions via equivalence or equiconsistency: generically $\\lambda$-supercompact for sets with wa generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa and $\\omega_1$-iterability ($\\alpha$-iterability for some $\\alpha&gt;1$) generically $\\lambda$-supercompact As with versions of generic measurability, several of the partial generic supercompacts are characterized by the existence of a winning strategy for the judge in one of the filter extension games on mini-supercompactness measures discussed in the previous post {% cite BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames %}. $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-strongly compact (nearly $\\lambda$-strongly compact) if and only if: $\\text{Judge}_{G_1(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$ $\\text{Judge}_{wG^*_\\omega(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$ $\\kappa$ is almost generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa (completely $\\lambda$-ineffable) if and only if $\\text{Judge}_{wG_\\omega(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$. If $\\text{Judge}_{G_\\omega(\\kappa,\\lambda,\\theta)}$ for every regular $\\theta&gt;\\lambda$, then $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact for sets with wa (by $\\text{Coll}(\\omega,H_\\theta)$). If $\\text{Judge}_{sG_\\omega(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$, then $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa and $\\omega_1$-iterability (by $\\text{Coll}(\\omega,H_{\\lambda^+})$). Suppose $2^\\lambda=\\lambda^+$. If $\\text{Judge}_{sG_\\omega(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$, then $\\kappa $ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact by $P(\\kappa)/I$ for a precipitious normal fine ideal $I$. For uncountable regular cardinals $\\delta$, $\\text{Judge}_{G_\\delta(\\kappa,\\lambda)}$ if and only if $\\kappa$ is generically $\\lambda$-supercompact with wa by $\\delta$-closed forcing.

	<h1>Filter extension games and generic large cardinals</h1>

	
      <p>
A cardinal $\kappa$ is called generically blah, where blah stands in for some large cardinal notion if $\kappa$ has some property characterizing the blah large cardinal in a forcing extension. So, for instance, a cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>generically measurable</em> if in a forcing extension there is an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive and $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, but $M$ not necessarily contained in $V$. Equivalently, $\kappa$ is generically measurable if some forcing extension has a <em>$V$-ultrafilter</em> - a filter measuring $P(\kappa)^V$ that is $V$-$\kappa$-complete and $V$-normal, with a well-founded ultrapower. For the reader familiar with the previous <a href="/research/2025/04/09/filter-extension-games-on-mini-supercompactness-filters">post</a>, this is precisely how we defined the notion of the external $M$-ultrafilter for a weak $\kappa$-model $M$. The reader of the previous <a href="/research/2025/04/09/filter-extension-games-on-mini-supercompactness-filters">post</a> will also have noticed that for external ultrafilters, such as $M$-ultrafilters, the property of weak amenability turns out to be quite important. So what if we further require that the $V$-ultrafilter in the forcing extension is weakly amenable? This cannot be equivalent to generic measurability because $\omega_1$ can be generically measurable, if say $\omega_1$ carries a precipitous uniform normal ideal, but if a forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter, then $\kappa$ is at least weakly compact and more (follows from <a href="#GitmanNielsenDimopoulos:virtualHierarchy">[1]</a>). What if we ask that the weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter have well-founded iterated ultrapowers? Of course, all these notions are equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal because generic measurability is already equiconsistent with it <a href="#jech:settheory">[2]</a>. So let's look at some natural weakenings of generic measurability. What if we ask that in a forcing extension, for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, there is an $H_\theta$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower? And what if we additionally ask that the $H_\theta$-ultrafilters are weakly amenable? We can also weaken generic measurability in a different direction by dropping the requirement that the $V$-ultrafilter produces a well-founded ultrapower, but maybe keeping weak amenability? Maybe even consider <em>weak</em> $V$-ultrafilters, where we drop the $V$-normality requirement?

</p>
<p>
We can also go off in an entirely different direction and care about which poset provides the forcing extension with the (weak) $V$-ultrafilter. Maybe we want the forcing extension to be by a poset of the form $P(\kappa)/I$ for a uniform normal ideal $I$ on $\kappa$. Or maybe we want the forcing to be $\gamma$-closed for some cardinal $\gamma$?
</p>
<p>
Assuming that a forcing extension has a $V$-ultrafilter has no large cardinal strength. If $\kappa$ is uncountable and regular, then the non-stationary ideal $NS_\kappa$ is normal, and so forcing with $P(\kappa)/NS_\kappa$ adds a $V$-ultrafilter. Conversely, if a forcing extension has a $V$-ultrafilter, then the ultrapower map $j:V\to M$, with $M$ potentially ill-founded, nontheless has critical point $\kappa$, which can be used to show that $\kappa$ is regular. But adding in weak amenability will give large cardinal strength.
</p>
<p>
It actually turns out that several of these variations on generic measurability are characterized by the existence of a winning strategy for the judge in the filter extension games discussed in the previous <a href="/research/2025/04/09/filter-extension-games-on-mini-supercompactness-filters">post</a>.

<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Can we construct a generic weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter not all of whose iterated ultrapowers are well-founded?
</p><p>
Let's move on now to generic supercompactness. In the setting of supercompactness, a <em>$V$-ultrafilter</em> is going to be a filter measuring $P(P_\kappa(\lambda))^V$ that is fine, $V$-$\kappa$-complete and $V$-normal. Without the $V$-normality assumption, we will say that the $V$-ultrafilter is <em>weak</em>. If the ultrapower is well-founded, we will say that it is <em>good</em>. A cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>generically $\lambda$-supercompact</em> if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, and $j''\lambda\in M$. Equivalently, $\kappa$ is generically $\lambda$-supercompact if some forcing extension has a good $V$-ultrafilter. A cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>generically $\lambda$-strongly compact</em> if and only if some forcing extension has an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ with $M$ transitive, $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$, and $j''\lambda\subseteq s$ with $|s|^M\lt j(\kappa)$. Equivalently, some forcing extension has a good weak $V$-ultrafilter. Now we can introduce all the same variations of partial generic supercompactness that we discussed above for generic measurability with many results generalizing, but also in this case a number of open questions.
</p>
<p>
We can define the notions of stationary, unbounded, and closed for subsets of $P_\kappa(\lambda)$ and show that the non-stationary ideal is fine and normal (see for, instance, <a href="#jech:settheory">[2]</a>). This shows that the existence of a $V$-ultrafilter does not carry large cardinal strength.
</p><p>
Here are the generic large cardinal notions corresponding to the ones we considered for generic measurability.

<p>
<ul>
<li> $\kappa$ is <em>almost generically $\lambda$-strongly compact with weak amenability (wa)</em> if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable weak $V$-ultrafilter.</li>
<li> $\kappa$ is <em>almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa)</em> if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter.</li>
<li> $\kappa$ is <em>generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets</em> if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has an $H_\theta$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower.</li>
<li>$\kappa$ is <em>generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa)  for sets</em> if for all sufficiently large regular $\theta$, some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $H_\theta$-ultrafilter.</li>
<li> $\kappa$ is <em>generically $\lambda$-supercompact with weak amenability (wa)</em> if some forcing extension has a weakly amenable good $V$-ultrafilter.</li>

</ul>
</p>
<p>
For what follows, we assume that $\lambda^{\lt\kappa}=\lambda$. Here is what we know about the strength of these notions <a href="#BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames">[5]</a>. See previous <a href="/research/2025/04/09/filter-extension-games-on-mini-supercompactness-filters">post</a> for definitions of nearly $\lambda$-strongly and supercompact cardinals.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li> $\kappa$ almost generically $\lambda$-strong with wa if and only if it is nearly $\lambda$-strongly compact.</li>
<li> $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa if and only if it is completely $\lambda$-ineffable.</li>
<li> The least $\kappa$ for which there is some $\lambda$ such that $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa is not generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa for sets.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Do nearly $\lambda$-supercompact cardinals have a generic large cardinal characterization?
</p><p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Are generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals equiconsistent with generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets cardinals with wa?</p>
<p>
For the corresponding generic measurability notions, it was shown that generically measurable for sets cardinals are generically measurable with wa for sets in $L$ <a href="#NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals">[4]</a>, but of course at this large cardinal level canonical models are not available.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Question</strong>: Can we separate the following notions via equivalence or equiconsistency:
<ul>
<li> generically $\lambda$-supercompact for sets with wa</li>
<li> generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa</li>
<li> generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa and $\omega_1$-iterability ($\alpha$-iterability for some $\alpha>1$)</li>
<li> generically $\lambda$-supercompact</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
As with versions of generic measurability, several of the partial generic supercompacts are characterized by the existence of a winning strategy for the judge in one of the filter extension games on mini-supercompactness measures discussed in the previous <a href="/research/2025/04/09/filter-extension-games-on-mini-supercompactness-filters">post</a> <a href="#BenhamouGitman:supercompactGames">[5]</a>.

</ul></li>
<li> $\kappa$ is almost generically $\lambda$-supercompact with wa (completely $\lambda$-ineffable) if and only if  $\text{Judge}_{wG_\omega(\kappa,\lambda)}$.</li>
