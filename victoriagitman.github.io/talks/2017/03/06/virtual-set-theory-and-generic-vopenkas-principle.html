      <p>This is a talk at the <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~bmcody/mamls2017/" target="_blank">VCU MAMLS Conference</a> in Richmond, Virginia, April 1, 2017.<!--more--></p>

<img src="/images/cardinal.jpg" style="float:left; padding: 10px;" /> The idea of considering <em>virtual</em> set theoretic assertions was introduced by Schindler, arising out of his work on remarkable cardinals. Suppose $\mathcal P$ is a set theoretic property asserting the existence of elementary embeddings between some first-order structures. We will say that $\mathcal P$ holds <em>virtually</em> if embeddings of structures from $V$ characterizing $\mathcal P$ exist in the generic multiverse of $V$ (in its set-forcing extensions). Large cardinals are primary candidates for virtualization. Recall, for instance, that a cardinal $\kappa$ is <em>extendible</em> if for every $\alpha>\kappa$, there is $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$ and $j(\kappa)>\alpha$. So we can say that $\kappa$ is <em>virtually extendible</em> if for every $\alpha>\kappa$ some set-forcing extension has an extendibility embedding $j:V_\alpha^V\to V_\beta^V$. We can do the same with an appropriately chosen characterization of supercompact cardinals based on the existence of embeddings of set-sized structures, as well as with several other large cardinals in the neighborhood of a supercompact. Other properties which seem to naturally lend themselves to virtualization are forcing axioms. Virtual versions of ${\rm PFA}$, ${\rm SCFA}$ (forcing axiom for subcomplete forcing) and resurrection axioms have been studied by Schindler and Fuchs <a href="#BagariaGitmanSchindler:VopenkaPrinciple">[1]</a>, <a href="#Fuchs:HierarchiesVirtualResurrectionAxioms">[2]</a>, <a href="#Fuchs:HierarchiesForcingAxiomsContinuumHypothesisSquarePrinciples">[3]</a>. Together with Bagaria and Schindler, we studied a virtual version of Vopěnka's Principle <a href="#BagariaGitmanSchindler:VopenkaPrinciple">[1]</a>.

<p>We can even have (consistent) virtual versions of inconsistent set-theoretic assertions. Observe for example that there can be a virtual elementary embedding from the reals to the rationals. To achieve this we simply force to collapse the cardinality of $\mathbb R$ to become countable so that in the collapse extension $\mathbb R^V$ is a countable dense linear order without end-points and hence isomorphic to the rationals. Of course the reals of the forcing extension still cannot be embedded into $\mathbb Q$ but virtual properties are about $V$-structures de re and not de dicto. It also turns out that Kunen's Inconsistency does not hold for virtual embeddings. In a set-forcing extension there can be elementary $j:V_\lambda^V\to V_\lambda^V$ with $\lambda$ much larger than the supremum of the critical sequence of $j$.</p>

<p>Schindler introduced remarkable cardinals when he discovered that a remarkable cardinal is equiconsistent with the assertion that the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ cannot be changed by proper forcing <a href="#schindler:remarkable2">[4]</a>. He defined that $\kappa$ is remarkable if for every $\lambda>\kappa$, there is $\bar\lambda<\kappa$ such that in a set-forcing extension there is an elementary $j:V_{\bar\lambda}^V\to V_\lambda^V$ with $j(\text{crit}(j))=\kappa$. By a theorem of Magidor <a href="#magidor:supercompact">[5]</a>, a cardinal $\kappa$ is supercompact precisely when the embeddings $j$ as above exist in $V$ itself. So remarkable cardinals are <em>virtually supercompac</em>t. Although it was conjectured that absoluteness of the theory of $L(\mathbb R)$ by proper forcing would have strength in the neighborhood of a strong cardinal, Schindler showed that remarkable cardinals are consistent with $V=L$ <a href="#schindler:remarkable1">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Calling remarkable cardinals virtually supercompact can seem like cheating because we chose a very peculiar characterization of supercompact cardinals to virtualize. We recently observed with Schindler that equivalently $\kappa$ is remarkable if for every $\lambda>\kappa$, there is $\alpha>\lambda$ and a transitive $M$ with $M^\lambda\subseteq M$ such that in a set-forcing extension there is $j:V_\alpha^V\to M$ with $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$ and $j(\kappa)>\lambda$. More surprising is another equivalent characterization that for every $\lambda>\kappa$, there is $\alpha>\lambda$ and a transitive $M$ with $V_\lambda\subseteq M$ such that in a set-forcing extension there is $j:V_\alpha^V\to M$ with $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$ and $j(\kappa)>\lambda$, making remarkables also look like virtually strong cardinals. A deeper reason for this appears to be that closure (in $V$) of the target model does not calibrate the strength of virtual large cardinals. Only large cardinals with characterization involving $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ have robust virtual versions [bibcite key=GitmanSchindler:virtualCardinals]. So we have robust virtual versions of supercompact, $C^{(n)}$-extendible, and rank-into-rank cardinals. The $n$-huge cardinals do not appear to have a robust characterization for virtualizing, so we instead virtualized a related hierarchy of $n$-huge* cardinals, where $\kappa$ is $n$-<em>huge*</em> if there is $\alpha>\kappa$ and $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with $\text{crit}(j)=\kappa$ and $j^n(\kappa)<\alpha$ <a href="#GitmanSchindler:virtualCardinals">[7]</a>. Schindler and Wilson recently defined a <em>virtual Shelah for supercompactness</em> cardinal and showed that it is equiconsistent with the assertion that every universally Baire set has a perfect subset <a href="#SchindlerWilson:UniversallyBaireSetsOfRealsPerfectSetProperty">[8]</a>. The hierarchy of virtual large cardinals mirrors that of their actual counterparts. If $0^{\#}$ exists, then the Silver indiscernibles have all the virtual large cardinal properties. The virtual large cardinals fit between 1-iterable and $\omega+1$-iterable cardinals and they are are downward absolute to $L$ <a href="#GitmanSchindler:virtualCardinals">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>With Bagaria and Schindler we introduced, <em>Generic Vopěnka's Principle</em>, a virtual version of Vopěnka's Principle <a href="#BagariaGitmanSchindler:VopenkaPrinciple">[1]</a>. <em>Vopěnka's Principle</em> asserts that every proper class of first-order structures has a pair of distinct structures that elementarily embed. Generic Vopěnka's Principle asserts that the embedding exists in a set-forcing extension. Vopěnka's Principle as well as its virtual version are second-order assertions formalizable in Godel-Bernays set theory. The first-order version of Vopěnka's Principle which I will call here, <em>Vopěnka's Scheme</em>, is the scheme of assertions ${\rm VP}(\Sigma_n)$ for every $n\in\omega$, which state that Vopěnka's Principle holds for $\Sigma_n$-definable (with parameters) classes. <em>Generic Vopěnka's Scheme</em> is the scheme of analogous assertions ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_n)$. Bagaria showed that ${\rm VP}(\Sigma_2)$ holds precisely when there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals and ${\rm VP}(\Sigma_{n+2})$ holds precisely when there is a proper class of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals <a href="#Bagaria:CnCardinals">[9]</a>. Recall that $C^{(n)}$ is the class of all $\delta$ such that $V_\delta\prec_{\Sigma_n}V$. A cardinal $\kappa$ is $C^{(n)}$-<em>extendible</em> if for every $\alpha>\kappa$ there is an extendibility embedding $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with $j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$.</p>

<p>With Bagaria and Schindler we showed that ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_2)$ is equiconsistent with a proper class of remarkable cardinals and ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_{n+2})$ is equiconsistent with a proper class of virtually $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals <a href="#BagariaGitmanSchindler:VopenkaPrinciple">[1]</a>. If there is a proper class of remarkable or virtually $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals then ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_2)$ or ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_{n+2})$ respectively holds. If ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_2)$ holds then there is a proper class of cardinals each of which is <em>either</em> remarkable or virtually rank-into-rank, and the analogous result holds for ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_{n+2})$ with remarkable replaced by virtually $C^{(n)}$-extendible. In Bagaria's argument you assumed that say there is no proper class of supercompacts and arrived at a contradiction by obtaining an embedding $j:V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}$. But in the virtual case, such an embedding simply indicates the presence of a virtually rank-into-rank cardinal. Was it possible to eliminate the pesky case of a virtually rank-into-rank cardinal with a cleverer argument? I tried unsuccessfully for months. Then last summer with Joel Hamkins we showed that Kunen's Inconsistency is fundamental to Bagaria's proof. There is a model of Generic Vopěnka's Scheme with no remarkable cardinals but a proper class of virtually rank-into-rank cardinals <a href="#GitmanHamkins:GVP">[10]</a>.</p>
