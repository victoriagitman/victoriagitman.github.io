	<h1>An absoluteness lemma for countable embeddings</h1>

	
      <p>If $W$ is a transitive set or class and it thinks that there is an elementary embedding $j$ between some first-order structures $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$, then $j$ is an actual elementary embedding and so the universe $V$ agrees that this is the case. Technically speaking, the existence of elementary embeddings between first-order structures is <em>upwards absolute</em> between transitive sets or classes. At this point, the reader's well-honed set theoretic intuition should immediately warn against the possibility of downward absoluteness.  <!--more--> If some larger model with lots more sets has an elementary embedding between two structures, there is no reason to suppose that a smaller poorer model would have one as well. It is not difficult to come up with counterexamples, so let's look at some, where the first-order structures are themselves models of set theory.</p>

<p>If $0^\sharp$ exists, then $V$ has a nontrivial elementary embedding $j:L_{\gamma}\to L_\delta$ for some $L$-cardinal $\gamma$ (with critical point $\kappa<\gamma$), but no such embedding can exist in $L$ because the ultrapower of $L$ by the ultrafilter $U$ generated from such an embedding $(U=\{A\mid \kappa\in j(A)\})$ is well-founded (this needs an argument), and therefore Mostowski collapses to give an elementary embedding $j:L\to L$ that is definable in $L$, which violates the Kunen Inconsistency <a href="#jech:settheory">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Other examples can be obtained by collapsing cardinals in a forcing extension. One of the prettiest results in the model theory of set theoretic structures (and models of ${\rm PA}$) states that any two countable computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ with the same theory and standard system must be isomorphic. The <em>standard system</em> of a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ consists of the standard initial segments of its reals (viewed as sequences of 0s and 1s). A model of ${\rm ZFC}$ is <em>computably saturated</em> if it already realizes all finitely realizable computable types (with parameters), where a type is <em>computable</em> if the collection of GÃ¶del codes of its formulas is computable. Obviously no model of size $\omega_1$ can embed into a countable model. So let's suppose we have a countable computably saturated $N\models{\rm ZFC}$ and a computably saturated $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ of size $\omega_1$ such that $M$ and $N$ are elementarily equivalent and have the same standard system. This is possible because fixing $N$, we can elementarily top-extend it $\omega_1$-many times to produce the required model $M$ (see this <a href="/talks/2013/11/13/a-jonsson-omega_1-like-model-of-set-theory/" target+"_blank">post</a> on $\omega_1$-like models). To ensure that $M$ is computably saturated, we use a deep theorem stating that a countable model $N$ is computably saturated if and only if it has a truth predicate $T\subseteq N$ such that $(N,\in,T)\models{\rm ZFC}$ <a href="#kaye:modelsofPA">[2]</a>, and instead of top-extending just $(N,\in)$, we top-extend $(N,\in,T)$. Because the final model $M$ has a truth predicate, it must be computably saturated (this easy direction does not require countability). So now go to a forcing extension $V[G]$, where $\omega_1$ is collapsed to $\omega$. There $M$ and $N$ are countable elementarily equivalent computably saturated models with the same standard system and therefore isomorphic!</p>

<p>Now having the counterexamples out of the way, we can get to the point of this post. The existence of an elementary embedding between structures $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ is downward absolute so long as $M$ is countable! </p>

<p><strong>Absoluteness Lemma:</strong> Suppose that $\mathcal M$ and $\mathcal N$ are countable first-order structures and $j:M\to N$ is an elementary embedding. If $W\subseteq V$ is a transitive (set or class) model of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ such that $\mathcal M$ is countable in $W$ and $\mathcal N\in W$, then $W$ has some elementary embedding $j^*:M\to N$. Furthermore, if $M$, $N$ are transitive models of set theory, $\text{cp}(j)=\gamma$ and $j(\gamma)=\delta$, we can additionally assume that $\text{cp}(j^*)=\gamma$ and $j^*(\gamma)=\delta$. Also, we can assume that $j$ and $j^*$ agree on some fixed finite number of values.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Fix some enumeration $M=\langle a_i\mid i\in\omega\rangle$ that exists in $W$. Say that a sequence $\langle b_0,\ldots,b_{n-1}\rangle$ of elements of $N$ is a <em>finite partial embedding</em> if for every formula $\varphi(x_0,\ldots,x_{n-1})$, we have that
<p align="center">$\mathcal M\models\varphi(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})\Leftrightarrow \mathcal N\models\varphi(b_0,\ldots,b_{n-1})$</p>
Let $T$ consist of all finite partial embeddings. Observe that $T$ is clearly a tree under the natural ordering by extension and it has height at most $\omega$. Also, $T$ is an element of $W$. Clearly any cofinal branch through $T$ gives an embedding $h:M\to N$. Let $c_i=j(a_i)$. Every sequence $\langle c_0,\ldots,c_{n-1}\rangle$ is a partial finite embedding in $W$ and the collection $\langle c_i\mid i\in\omega\rangle$ is a cofinal branch through $T$ in $V$. Thus, the tree $T$ is ill-founded in $V$. But then $T$ must be ill-founded in $W$ as well because otherwise $W$ would have rank function for $T$ and this rank function would attest to its well-foundedness in $V$. Thus, $W$ has a cofinal branch through $T$ and this branch gives some embedding $j^*:M\to N$. To achieve that $j$ and $j^*$ agree on the critical point, we limit the tree $T$ to partial finite embeddings fixing all $\alpha$ below the critical point of $j$ and having $b_n=\delta$, where $a_n=\gamma$. An agreement on some finitely many values is achieved similarly. $\square$</p>

<p>I learned about this folklore absoluteness lemma while working with <a href="/talks/2014/03/01/introduction-to-remarkable-cardinals/" target="_blank">remarkable cardinals</a>, many of whose remarkable properties tend to magically materialize out of its application. This proof came out of a discussion with Joel Hamkins, who interrupted my convoluted argument with his usual "but wait, isn't it like this...." and everything quickly became crystal clear.</p>
