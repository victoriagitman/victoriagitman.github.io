<meta name="description" content="{% reference page.ref %} Vopěnka&#39;s Principle is a large cardinal principle which states that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type there are $B\neq A$, both in $\mathcal C$, such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$. It can be formalized in first-order set theory as a schema, where for each natural number $n$ in the meta-theory there is a formula expressing that Vopěnka&#39;s Principle holds for all $\Sigma_n$-definable (with parameters) classes. Following {% cite Bagaria:CnCardinals %}, we call ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the fragment of Vopěnka&#39;s Principle for $\Sigma_n$-definable classes and let ${\rm VP}(\Sigma_n)$ be the weaker principle, where parameters are not allowed in the definition of the class (with analogous definitions for $\Pi_n$). Bagaria introduced in {% cite Bagaria:CnCardinals %} a family of Vopěnka-like principles ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$, where $\kappa$ is a cardinal, which state that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type that is $\Sigma_n$-definable with parameters in $H_\kappa$ (the collection of all sets of hereditary size less than $\kappa$), $\mathcal C$ reflects below $\kappa$, namely for every $A\in\mathcal C$ there is $B\in H_\kappa\cap \mathcal C$ that elementarily embeds into $A$. Bagaria established a relationship between Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragments and his family of principles ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ and provided a complete characterization of Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragments ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_n)$, as well as the weaker principles ${\rm VP}(\Pi_n)$, in terms of the existence of supercompact and $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals {% cite Bagaria:CnCardinals %}. Recall that $C^{(n)}$ denotes the class club of ordinals $\delta$ such that $V_\delta\prec_{\Sigma_n} V$. A cardinal $\kappa$ is called $C^{(n)}$-extendible if for every $\alpha&gt;\kappa$, there is an elementary embedding $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with critical point $\kappa$ and with $j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$. Note that every extendible cardinal is $1$-extendible. Bagaria {% cite Bagaria:CnCardinals %} showed that the weaker principle ${\rm VP}(\Pi_1)$ holds if and only if for some $\kappa$, ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_2)$ holds, and if and only if there is a supercompact cardinal. Also, for $n\geq 1$, ${\rm VP}(\Pi_{n+1})$ holds if and only if for some $\kappa$, ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+2})$ holds, and if and only if there is a $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal. The results generalize to show that the Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragment ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_1)$ holds if and only if ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_2)$ holds for a proper class of $\kappa$, and if and only if there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals. Also, for $n\geq 1$, ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_{n+1})$ holds if and only if ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+2})$ holds for a proper class of $\kappa$, and if and only if there is a proper class of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals. Thus, Vopěnka&#39;s Principle holds precisely when, for every $n\in\omega$, there is a proper class of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals. In this article, we introduce and study generic versions of Vopěnka&#39;s Principle and its variants. The Generic Vopěnka&#39;s Principle states that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type there are $B\neq A$, both in $\mathcal C$, such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in some set-forcing extension. We call ${\rm gVP}(\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the Generic Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragment for $\Sigma_n$-definable (with parameters) classes and we let ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_n)$ be the weaker principle where parameters are not allowed in the definition of the class (with analogous definitions for $\Pi_n$). We also call ${\rm gVP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the analogous generic version of ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$. It turns out that an elementary embedding $j:B\to A$ between first-order structures exists in some set-forcing extension if and only if it already exists in $V^{\rm{Coll}(\omega,B)}$. We show that to every pair of structures $B$ and $A$ of the same type, we can associate a closed game $G(B,A)$ such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,B)}$ precisely when a particular player has a winning strategy in that game. The game $G(B,A)$ is a variant of an Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game of length $\omega$, where player I starts out by playing some $b_0\in B$ and player II responds by playing $a_0\in A$. Players I and II continue to alternate, choosing elements $b_n$ and $a_n$ from their respective structures at stage $n$ of the game. Player II wins if for every formula $\varphi(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$, $$B\models \varphi(b_0,\ldots,b_n)\leftrightarrow A\models\varphi(a_0,\ldots,a_n),$$ and otherwise player I wins. Since if player II loses she must do so at some finite stage of the game, the game $G(B,A)$ is closed and hence determined by the Gale-Stewart theorem {% cite GaleStewart1953:InfiniteGamesWithPerfectInformation %}. Thus, either player I or player II has a winning strategy. We show that player II has a winning strategy precisely when $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,B)}$. It follows that each first-order fragment of Generic Vopěnka&#39;s Principle is characterized by the existence of certain winning strategies in its associated class of closed games. The consistency strength of Generic Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragments is measured by a hierarchy of cardinals, the $n$-remarkable cardinals we introduce here, which generalize Schindler&#39;s remarkable cardinals analogously to how $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals generalize extendible cardinals. A remarkable cardinal (which is $1$-remarkable by our definition) is a type of generic supercompact cardinal and, correspondingly, an $n$-remarkable cardinal (for $n&gt;1$) is a type of generic $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal. The $n$-remarkable cardinals sit relatively low in the large cardinal hierarchy. Call a large cardinal completely remarkable if it is $n$-remarkable for every $n\in\omega$. Completely remarkable cardinals can exist in $L$ and the consistency of a completely remarkable cardinal follows from a $2$-iterable cardinal. We show that the Generic Vopěnka&#39;s Principle fragment ${\rm gVP}(\Pi_n)$ is equiconsistent with an $n$-remarkable cardinal. Theorem: The following are equiconsistent. &lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top: -20px;&quot;;&gt; ${\rm gVP}(\Pi_n)$. ${\rm gVP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+1})$ for some $\kappa$. There is an $n$-remarkable cardinal. &lt;/ol&gt; The result generalizes to the bold-face ${\rm gVP}(\mathbf\Pi_n)$ principles. Theorem: The following are equiconsistent. &lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top: -20px;&quot;;&gt; ${\rm gVP}(\mathbf\Pi_n)$. ${\rm gVP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+1})$ for a proper class of $\kappa$. There is a proper class of $n$-remarkable cardinals. &lt;/ol&gt; The notion of a generic embedding existing in some forcing extension leads naturally to a weak version of the Proper Forcing Axiom ${\rm PFA}$, which we introduce and study here. Schindler and Claverie showed in {% cite ClaverieSchindler:pfa %} that ${\rm PFA}$ has the following equivalent formulation. Theorem: The following are equivalent. &lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top: -20px;&quot;;&gt; ${\rm PFA}$ If ${\mathcal M} = (M;\in,(R_i \mid i&lt;\omega_1))$ is a transitive model, $\varphi(x)$ is a $\Sigma_1$-formula, and ${\mathbb Q}$ is a proper forcing such that $$\Vdash_{\mathbb Q} \varphi({\mathcal M}),$$ then there is in $V$ some transitive ${\bar{\mathcal M}}=({\bar M};\in,({\bar R}_i \mid i&lt;\omega_1))$ together with some elementary embedding $$j : {\bar {\mathcal M}} \rightarrow {\mathcal M}$$ such that $\varphi({\bar {\mathcal M}})$ holds. &lt;/ol&gt; By weakening this formulation of ${\rm PFA}$ to say that the embedding $j$ exists in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,\bar M)}$, we obtain the weak Proper Forcing Axiom ${\rm wPFA}$. We show that ${\rm wPFA}$ is equiconsistent with a remarkable cardinal. Theorem: &lt;ol style=&quot;margin-top: -20px;&quot;;&gt; If $\kappa$ is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which ${\rm wPFA}$ holds. If ${\rm wPFA}$ holds, then $\omega_2^V$ is remarkable in $L$. &lt;/ol&gt; The principle ${\rm wPFA}$ implies ${\rm PFA}_{\aleph_2}$, the Proper Forcing Axiom for meeting antichains of size $\leq\aleph_2$, but it does not imply ${\rm PFA}_{\aleph_3}$.

<p><em>Vopěnka's Principle</em> is a large cardinal principle which states that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type there are $B\neq A$, both in $\mathcal C$, such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$. It can be formalized in first-order set theory as a schema, where for each natural number $n$ in the meta-theory there is a formula expressing that Vopěnka's Principle holds for all $\Sigma_n$-definable (with parameters) classes. Following <a href="#Bagaria:CnCardinals">[1]</a>, we call ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the fragment of Vopěnka's Principle for $\Sigma_n$-definable classes and let ${\rm VP}(\Sigma_n)$ be the weaker principle, where parameters are not allowed in the definition of the class (with analogous definitions for $\Pi_n$). Bagaria introduced in <a href="#Bagaria:CnCardinals">[1]</a>  a family of Vopěnka-like principles ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$, where $\kappa$ is a cardinal, which state that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type that is $\Sigma_n$-definable with parameters in $H_\kappa$ (the collection of all sets of hereditary size less than $\kappa$), $\mathcal C$ reflects below $\kappa$, namely for every $A\in\mathcal C$ there is $B\in H_\kappa\cap \mathcal C$ that elementarily embeds into $A$. Bagaria established a relationship between Vopěnka's Principle fragments and his family of principles ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ and provided a complete characterization of Vopěnka's Principle fragments ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_n)$, as well as the weaker principles ${\rm VP}(\Pi_n)$, in terms of the existence of supercompact and $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals <a href="#Bagaria:CnCardinals">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Recall that $C^{(n)}$ denotes the class club of ordinals $\delta$ such that $V_\delta\prec_{\Sigma_n} V$. A cardinal $\kappa$ is called $C^{(n)}$-<em>extendible</em> if for every $\alpha>\kappa$, there is an elementary embedding $j:V_\alpha\to V_\beta$ with critical point $\kappa$ and with $j(\kappa)\in C^{(n)}$. Note that every extendible cardinal is $1$-extendible. Bagaria <a href="#Bagaria:CnCardinals">[1]</a> showed that the weaker principle ${\rm VP}(\Pi_1)$ holds if and only if for some $\kappa$, ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_2)$ holds, and if and only if there is a supercompact cardinal. Also, for $n\geq 1$, ${\rm VP}(\Pi_{n+1})$ holds if and only if for some $\kappa$, ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+2})$ holds, and  if and only if there is a $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal. The results generalize to show that the Vopěnka's Principle fragment ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_1)$ holds if and only if ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_2)$ holds for a proper class of $\kappa$, and if and only if there is a proper class of supercompact cardinals. Also, for $n\geq 1$, ${\rm VP}(\mathbf\Pi_{n+1})$ holds if and only if ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_{n+2})$ holds for a proper class of $\kappa$, and  if and only if there is a proper class of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals. Thus, Vopěnka's Principle holds precisely when, for every $n\in\omega$, there is a proper class of $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals.</p>

<p>In this article, we introduce and study generic versions of Vopěnka's Principle and its variants. The <em>Generic Vopěnka's Principle</em> states that for every proper class $\mathcal C$ of structures of the same type there are $B\neq A$, both in $\mathcal C$, such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in some set-forcing extension.  We call ${\rm gVP}(\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the Generic Vopěnka's Principle fragment for $\Sigma_n$-definable (with parameters) classes and we let ${\rm gVP}(\Sigma_n)$ be the weaker principle where parameters are not allowed in the definition of the class (with analogous definitions for $\Pi_n$). We also call ${\rm gVP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$ the analogous generic version of ${\rm VP}(\kappa,\mathbf\Sigma_n)$.</p>

<p>It turns out that an elementary embedding $j:B\to A$ between first-order structures exists in some set-forcing extension if and only if it already exists in $V^{\rm{Coll}(\omega,B)}$. We show that to every pair of structures $B$ and $A$ of the same type, we can associate a closed game $G(B,A)$ such that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,B)}$ precisely when a particular player has a winning strategy in that game. The game $G(B,A)$ is a variant of an Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game of length $\omega$, where player I starts out by playing some $b_0\in B$ and player II responds by playing $a_0\in A$. Players I and II continue to alternate, choosing elements $b_n$ and $a_n$ from their respective structures at stage $n$ of the game. Player II wins if for every formula $\varphi(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$, $$B\models \varphi(b_0,\ldots,b_n)\leftrightarrow A\models\varphi(a_0,\ldots,a_n),$$ and otherwise player I wins. Since if player II loses she must do so at some finite stage of the game, the game $G(B,A)$ is closed and hence determined by the Gale-Stewart theorem <a href="#GaleStewart1953:InfiniteGamesWithPerfectInformation">[2]</a>. Thus, either player I or player II has a winning strategy. We show that player II has a winning strategy precisely when $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,B)}$. It follows that each first-order fragment of Generic Vopěnka's Principle is characterized by the existence of certain winning strategies in its associated class of closed games.</p>

<p>The consistency strength of Generic Vopěnka's Principle fragments is measured by a hierarchy of cardinals, the $n$-<em>remarkable</em> cardinals we introduce here, which generalize Schindler's remarkable cardinals analogously to how $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinals generalize extendible cardinals. A remarkable cardinal (which is $1$-remarkable by our definition) is a type of generic supercompact cardinal and, correspondingly, an $n$-remarkable cardinal (for $n>1$) is a type of generic $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal. The $n$-remarkable cardinals sit relatively low in the large cardinal hierarchy. Call a large cardinal <em>completely remarkable</em> if it is $n$-remarkable for every $n\in\omega$. Completely remarkable cardinals can exist in $L$ and the consistency of a completely remarkable cardinal follows from a $2$-iterable cardinal. We show that the Generic Vopěnka's Principle fragment ${\rm gVP}(\Pi_n)$ is equiconsistent with an $n$-remarkable cardinal.</p>

<p>The result generalizes to the bold-face ${\rm gVP}(\mathbf\Pi_n)$ principles.</p>

The notion of a generic embedding existing in some forcing extension leads naturally to a weak version of the Proper Forcing Axiom ${\rm PFA}$, which we introduce and study here. Schindler and Claverie showed in <a href="#ClaverieSchindler:pfa">[3]</a> that ${\rm PFA}$ has the following equivalent formulation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong>: The following are equivalent.
<ol style="margin-top: -20px;";>
	<li>
${\rm PFA}$</li>
<li> If ${\mathcal M} = (M;\in,(R_i \mid i<\omega_1))$ is a transitive model, $\varphi(x)$ is a $\Sigma_1$-formula, and ${\mathbb Q}$ is a proper forcing
such that $$\Vdash_{\mathbb Q} \varphi({\mathcal M}),$$ then there is in $V$ some transitive ${\bar{\mathcal M}}=({\bar M};\in,({\bar R}_i \mid
i<\omega_1))$ together with some elementary embedding $$j : {\bar {\mathcal M}} \rightarrow {\mathcal M}$$ such that $\varphi({\bar {\mathcal M}})$ holds. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>By weakening this formulation of ${\rm PFA}$ to say that the embedding $j$ exists in $V^{\rm {Coll}(\omega,\bar M)}$, we obtain the <em>weak Proper Forcing Axiom</em> ${\rm wPFA}$.</p>

<p>We show that ${\rm wPFA}$ is equiconsistent with a remarkable cardinal.</p>
<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong>:
<ol style="margin-top: -20px;";>
	<li>
If $\kappa$ is remarkable, then there is a forcing extension in which ${\rm wPFA}$ holds. </li>
<li> If ${\rm wPFA}$ holds, then $\omega_2^V$ is remarkable in $L$.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The principle ${\rm wPFA}$ implies ${\rm PFA}_{\aleph_2}$, the Proper Forcing Axiom for meeting antichains of size $\leq\aleph_2$, but it does not imply ${\rm PFA}_{\aleph_3}$.</p>
