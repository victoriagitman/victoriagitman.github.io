<p>I introduced the notions of <em>proper</em> and <em>piecewise proper</em> families of reals to make progress on a long standing open question in the field of models of Peano Arithmetic <a href="#gitman:scott">[1]</a>. A family of reals is <em>proper</em> if it is arithmetically closed and its quotient Boolean algebra modulo the ideal of finite sets is a proper poset. A family of reals is <em>piecewise proper</em> if it is the union of a chain of proper families each of whom has size $\leq\omega_1$.</p>

<p>Here, I investigate the question of the existence of proper and piecewise proper families of reals of different cardinalities. I show that it is consistent relative to ${\rm ZFC}$ to have continuum many proper families of cardinality $\omega_1$ and continuum many piecewise proper families of cardinality $\omega_2$.</p>
