	<h1>A Jonsson $\omega_1$-like model of set theory</h1>

	
      <p>This is a talk at the <a href="http://nylogic.org/set-theory" target="_blank">CUNY Set Theory Seminar</a>, November 15, 2013.<!--more--></p>

<p>In 1962, Bjarni Jónsson asked whether there is a cardinal $\kappa$ such that every first-order structure (in a countable language) of size $\kappa$ has an elementary substructure of size $\kappa$. In his honor, a first-order structure is called <em>Jónsson</em> if it has no proper elementary substructures of its cardinality, and a cardinal $\kappa$ is called  <em>Jónsson</em> if there are no Jónsson structures of size $\kappa$. It turns out that Jónsson cardinals are large! For instance, if there is a Jónsson cardinal, then $0^\sharp$ exists. It is known that $\omega_1$ cannot Jónsson, meaning that there are Jónsson first-order structures of size $\omega_1$. In this talk, I will prove a theorem of Julia Knight that there is a Jónsson $\omega_1$-like model of set theory <a href="#knight:hanfnumbers">[1]</a>. </p>

A model of set theory is $\omega_1$-<em>like</em> if it has size $\omega_1$, but all its rank initial segments are countable (read more <a href="/talks/2013/10/01/embeddings-among-omega_1-like-models-of-set-theory/" target="_blank">here</a>). An $\omega_1$-like model with some desired property $P$ is usually built up as the union of an elementary chain of length $\omega_1$ of countable models, where the successor stage elementary extensions only add elements on top and have some additional structure which at the end allows us to verify $P$. If there is a countable model of set theory, then there is an $\omega_1$-like model of set theory because every countable model has a <em>top</em> elementary extension. 

<p>Keisler and Morley <a href="#keislermorley:topextensions">[2]</a> proved that every countable model has a top extension using an omitting types argument. Suppose that $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is countable. Extend the language of set theory by adding constants $c$ for all elements of $M$ and an additional constant $e$. Let $T_M$ be the theory ${\rm Th}(M,c)_{c\in M}$ together with the sentence "$e$ is an ordinal" and the collection of sentences $\{e>\alpha\mid\alpha\in{\rm ORD}^M\}$. For every $c\in M$, we define the corresponding type $p_c(x)$ consisting of the formula $x\in^M c$ and the formulas $\{x\neq b\mid b\in^M c\}$. Using the Omitting Types Theorem, it is not difficult to see that $T_M$ has a model omitting all types $p_c(x)$ and this is our desired top extension.</p>

<p>Another folklore proof uses a variation on the Skolem ultrapower construction. Skolem ultrapowers were introduced by Skolem who used them to show that there is a countable nonstandard model of the Peano Axioms. The ultrapower is built out of definable functions $F:{\rm ORD}^M\to M$ and an ultrafilter on the definable classes of ordinals of $M$. If $M$ has a definable global well-order, the ultrapower satisfies the Łoś Theorem. If it doesn't, we can use forcing (see <a href="/research/2013/10/09/forcing-to-add-proper-classes-to-a-model-of-rm-gbc-an-introduction/" target="_blank">here</a>) to extend it to a model of ${\rm GBC}$ (Gödel-Bernays set theory) and build the ultrapower out of this larger collection of classes. By choosing an ultrafilter with the property that every class function $F:M\to V_\alpha^M$ is constant on some set in it, we ensure that the ultrapower is a top extension. </p>

<p>Julia Knight's construction of a Jónsson $\omega_1$-like model hinges on the following observation. Let $p(x,y)$ be the type expressing that $x$ and $y$ are not definable from each other. It is easy to see that any model of size $\omega_1$ which omits $p(x,y)$ must be Jónsson. Knight shows that that if $M$ itself omits $p(x,y)$, then the theory $T_M$  has a model which omits $p(x,y)$. Since we can omit countably many types at once, we can omit all $p_c(x)$ together with $p(x,y)$ to obtain a top extension.</p>

<p>Ali Enayat's <a href="#enayat:jonsson">[3]</a> construction of a Jónsson $\omega_1$-like model uses superminimal extensions obtained via Skolem ultrapowers. Suppose that $M\models{\rm ZFC}+V={\rm OD}$ (every element is ordinal definable). An elementary extension $N$ of $M$ is called <em>superminimal</em> if for every $a\in N\setminus M$, we have $N={\rm Scl}(a)$, the Skolem hull of $\{a\}$. It is easy to see that if $M$ is an elementary chain of length $\omega_1$ of countable models, where the successor stage extensions are superminimal, then it is Jónsson. Enayat shows that every countable model $M\models{\rm ZFC}+V={\rm OD}$ has a Skolem ultrapower that is a superminimal top extension by carefully choosing the ultrafilter. </p>
