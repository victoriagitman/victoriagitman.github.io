	<h1>A natural model of the multiverse axioms</h1>

	
      <p>This is a talk at the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/logic/seminar.html" target="_blank">MIT Logic Seminar</a>, April 8, 2010. <!--more--></p>

<p>In the past decades, set theorists have studied a multitude of set theoretic universes constructed as forcing extensions or sub-models and often incorporating strong axioms of infinity. Cohen’s forcing was generalized to build extensions according to nearly any desired recipe, while Gödel’s construction of L was generalized to obtain increasingly sophisticated sub-models. Against this background, it can be argued that set theory moved away from the study of the set theoretic universe to that of the set theoretic Multiverse. Philosophically, a multiverse encompasses a rich collection of possible ZFC-universes. It should include universes satisfying or failing to satisfy the Continuum Hypothesis, Martin’s Axiom, $\diamondsuit$-principle, etc. Some universes in the multiverse should be countable from the perspective of other universes, some ill-founded, and some ultrapowers. The multiverses admit a purely mathematical, non-philosophical treatment as mathematical objects in ZFC. We define that a <em>multiverse</em> is simply a nonempty set or class of models of ZFC. The <em>Multiverse Axioms</em> for such collections are intended to capture the richness and interconnectedness of the ZFC worlds. They include:
<ul>
<li>
A definable class of a member of the multiverse is also a member. 
</li>
<li>
A forcing extension of a member of the multiverse is also a member. 
</li>
<li>
Every member of the multiverse is countable/ill-founded from the perspective of another member.
</li>
<li>
Every member of the multiverse is an internal ultrapower of another member; every definable elementary embedding of a member is an iterate of an embedding of another member.
</li>
</ul>
In this talk, I will introduce the multiverse axioms and show that if ${\rm ZFC}$ is consistent, then the collection of all countable computably saturated models of ZFC is a natural model of the multiverse axioms. A model is <em>computably saturated</em> if it already realizes all its finitely realizable computable types. This is joint work with Joel David Hamkins.</p>
