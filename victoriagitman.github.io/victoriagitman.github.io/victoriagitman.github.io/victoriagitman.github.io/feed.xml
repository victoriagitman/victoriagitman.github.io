&lt;p&gt;In the early 20th century, optimism ran high that a formal development of mathematics through first-order logic within appropriate axiom systems would set up mathematical knowledge as incontrovertible truth. With the introdution of set theory, all mathematics could now be unified within a single field whose fundamental properties were codified by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms ${\rm ZFC}$. But already within a few decades, discoveries were made which suggested that the concept of set was prone to relativity. Löwenheim and Skolem showed that if there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then there is a countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$. This countable model would, of course, think that its reals are uncountable, demonstrating the non-absoluteness of countability. Gödel proved the Completeness Theorem, an immediate consequences of which was the existence of nonstandard models of set theory, even with nonstandard natural numbers, demonstrating the non-absoluteness of well-foundedness. Soon afterwards, Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem showed the general limitations inherent in formal method: no computable theory extending ${\rm ZFC}$ could decide the truth of all set theoretic assertions. In the next few decades came forcing, large cardinals, canonical inner models, and a model theoretic treatment of ${\rm ZFC}$. Set theory ever since has indisputably been the study of a multiverse of universes each instantiating its own concept of set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohen's technique of forcing showed how to extend a given universe of sets to a larger universe satisfying a desired list of properties. Forcing could be used to construct universes in which the continuum was any cardinal of uncountable cofinality (including singular cardinals), indeed the continuum function on the regular cardinals could be made to satisfy any desired pattern (modulo a few necessary restrictions). There could be universes with or without a Suslin line, universes with non-constructible reals, universes whose cardinal characteristics had different values and different relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, set theorists started exploring the consistency strength hierarchy of large cardinal axioms asserting existence of improbably large infinite objects. Other set theoretic assertions, no matter how unrelated to large cardinals, inevitably fell somewhere inside the hierarchy. Set theorists could now combine forcing with large cardinals to produce universes in which large cardinals were compatible with other desired properties. Many of the larger large cardinals implied that the universe had transitive sub-universes (inner models) into which it would elementarily embed. Such sub-universes, obtained from large cardinals or through other considerations, joined the menagerie of mathematical worlds populating the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yet another direction, motivated by Godel's construction of $L$, set theorists began exploring how to build ever more sophisticated canonical inner models, universes built bottom-up from a recipe specifying what kind of sets should exists. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, a model theoretic treatment of ${\rm ZFC}$ produced some unexpected results. Given two models $M$ and $N$ of ${\rm ZFC}$, let us say that $N$ is an &lt;em&gt;end-extension&lt;/em&gt; of $M$ if $M$ is transitive in $N$, let us say that $N$ is a &lt;em&gt;top-extension&lt;/em&gt; of $M$ if every element of $N\setminus M$ has higher rank than all ordinals of $M$. Keisler and Morley showed that every countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$ has a proper elementary top-extension (Keisler-Morley Extension Theorem &lt;a href=&quot;#keislermorley:topextensions&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, any countable model could be grown in height without changing its theory. Barwise showed that every countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$ has an end-extension to a model of $V=L$ (Barwise Extension Theorem &lt;a href=&quot;#Barwise:extensionTheorem&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, sets could become constructible in a larger universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does set theoretic practice tell us about the nature of sets? Is there the one true universe of sets, the mathematical world in which all mathematics lives, but our epistemic limitations have so far prevented us from understanding its structure? Or is there simply no one true universe, and instead the multiverse of universes encountered by set theorists is the true mathematical reality?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Universist position in the philosophy of set theory asserts that there is the one true universe of sets. Incompleteness is simply a by-product of formal methods we are forced to use to investigate mathematics, not an indication of some inherent relativity in the nature of sets. After all, in spite of a plethora of nonstandard models of arithmetic, most mathematicians would agree that the natural numbers is the only true model of arithmetic. The Peano Axioms, actually do a rather excellent job of capturing the fundamental properties of natural numbers, they are bound by the incompleteness phenomena but number theorists don't often run into statements independent of them. This certainty with regards to number theory comes from the deep intuition we believe we hold about the nature of natural numbers. The goal of set theory should then be to obtain the same deep intuition about the nature of sets so that ${\rm ZFC}$ can be extended to a theory deciding most of the more significant properties of sets. Woodin for instance believes that such a theory will come from a construction of a sufficiently sophisticated canonical inner model compatible with all known large cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Multiversist position in the philosophy of set theory asserts that there is simply no one true universe of sets. All universes of sets discovered by set theorists: forcing extensions, canonical and non-canonical inner models, models with and without large cardinals, have equal ontological status. They all populate the multiverse of mathematical worlds, each instantiating its own equally valid concept of set. The Multiversist position splits along the lines of just how non-absolute should the notion of set be under this view. Can the multiverse contain models of different heights? Are ill-founded models allowed? The Radical Multiversist position, espoused most notably by Hamkins, asserts that all these models belong in the multiverse. Indeed, once you adapt the position that there is no absolute set theoretic background, no background aught to be better than any other and in fact each should be as bad as the next in the following sense. In the Hamkins perspective each universe in the multiverse will be seen to be countable and ill-founded from the perspective of a &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; universe. In particular, under this view the universist is mistaken even about the nature of the natural numbers. The Hamkins position is captured by his &lt;em&gt;Multiverse Axioms&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realizability&lt;/strong&gt;: If $M$ is a universe and $N$ is a definable class in $M$ such that $M$ believes that $N\models{\rm ZFC}$, then $N$ is a universe. (This includes set models, inner models, will-founded models, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forcing Extension&lt;/strong&gt;: If $M$ is a universe and $\mathbb P\in M$ is a forcing notion, then there is a universe $M[G]$ where $G\subseteq\mathbb P$ is $M$-generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Forcing Extension&lt;/strong&gt;: If $M$ is a universe  and $\mathbb P$ is a definable ${\rm ZFC}$-preserving forcing notion in $M$, then there is a universe $M[G]$ where $G\subseteq \mathbb P$ is $V$-generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflection&lt;/strong&gt;: If $M$ is a universe, then there is a universe $N$ such that $M\prec V^N_\theta\prec N$ for some rank initial segment $V^N_\theta$ of $N$. (Recall the Keisler-Morley Extension Theorem.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countability&lt;/strong&gt;: Every universe $M$ is a countable set in another universe $N$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well-founded Mirage&lt;/strong&gt;: Every universe $M$ is a set in another universe $N$ which thinks that $\mathbb N^M$ is ill-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse Embedding&lt;/strong&gt;: If $M$ is a universe and $j:M\to N$ is an elementary embedding definable in $M$, then there is a universe $M^*$ and an elementary embedding $j^*:M^*\to M$ definable in $M^*$ such that $j=j^*(j^*)$. (Every elementary embedding has already been iterated many times.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorbtion into $L$&lt;/strong&gt;: Every universe $M$ is a transitive set in another universe $N$ satisfying $V=L$. (This is stronger than the Barwise Extension Theorem.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A way to investigate the viability of a collection of multiverse axioms, without coming up with a formal background beyond ${\rm ZFC}$, is by considering toy multiverses of ${\rm ZFC}$ models. Assuming that ${\rm ZFC}$ is consistent, a toy multiverse is some set collection of models of ${\rm ZFC}$. Does a given collection of multiverse axioms have a toy multiverse, does it have a &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; toy multiverse? With Hamkins, we showed that his Multiverse Axioms, radical as their assertions may seem, have a very natural toy multiverse, namely the collection of all countable computably saturated models &lt;a href=&quot;#multiverse:gitmanhamkins&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, every model in any toy multiverse satisfying the Hamkins Multiverse Axioms must be computably saturated because every model of ${\rm ZFC}$ that is an element of a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ with an ill-founded $\omega$ is computably saturated (see the previous &lt;a href=&quot;/research/2019/06/04/some-cute-observations-about-computably-saturated-models/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent joint work with Godziszewski, Meadows, and Williams, we consider various weakenings of the Hamkins Multiverse Axioms that have toy multiverses not consisting entirely of computably saturated models. First, we consider the Hamkins Multiverse Axioms with a weak version of well-founded mirage which asserts that every universe in the multiverse is merely ill-founded, not necessarily at $\omega$, from the perspective of a better universe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak well-founded mirage&lt;/strong&gt;: Every universe $M$ is a set in another universe which thinks that its membership relation is ill-founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall that if there is a transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then the &lt;em&gt;Cohen-Shepherdson model $L_\alpha$&lt;/em&gt; is the minimum transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: (G., Godziszewki, Meadows, Williams) The collection in $L_\alpha$ of all models $M$ such that $L_\alpha$ thinks that $M$ is a countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$ satisfies:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realizability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Forcing and Class Forcing Extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak Well-founded Mirage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we consider weakening the axioms to the so-called covering versions, where instead of demanding that a universe be a set inside another universe, we ask that each universe has, a &lt;em&gt;cover&lt;/em&gt;, an end-extension that is a set in a better universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covering Countability&lt;/strong&gt;: For every universe $M$, there is a universe $N$ and a countable set $A\in N$ with $M\subseteq A$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covering Well-founded Mirage&lt;/strong&gt;: For every universe $M$, there is a universe $N$ and a model $M^*\in N$ end-extending $M$ such that $N$ thinks that $\mathbb N^{M^*}$ is ill-founded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covering Absorbtion into $L$&lt;/strong&gt;: For every universe $M$, there is a universe $N\models{\rm ZFC}+V=L$ and a model $M^*\in N$ end-extending $M$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: (G., Godziszewki, Meadows, Williams) There is a toy multiverse, not all of whose models are computably saturated, satisfying:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realizability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing Extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class Forcing Extension for ${\rm Ord}$-cc forcing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covering Countability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covering Well-founded Mirage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covering Absorbtion into $L$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I purposely didn't tell you what my philosophical position is on all of this. I will leave it up to the reader to guess.&lt;/p&gt;

Let $\mathcal L$ be any computable first-order language. A type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ in $\mathcal L$ is said to be &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt; if the collection of Gödel codes of the formulas in the type $$\{\ulcorner \varphi\urcorner\mid \varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)\}$$ is a computable set. A model $M$ of $\mathcal L$ is said to be &lt;em&gt;computably saturated&lt;/em&gt; if for every tuple $\bar a\in M$ and every computable type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$, whenever $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable in $M$, then $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is realized: there is a tuple $\bar b\in M$ such that for every $\varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)$, $M\models\varphi(\bar b,\bar a)$. It is not difficult to see that any model $M$ of cardinality $\kappa$ has a computably saturated elementary extension of cardinality $\kappa$. We build the elementary extension in $\omega$-many steps, at each step realizing all finitely realizable computable types with parameters from the previous stage. Observe that any computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ must have nonstandard natural numbers because it realizes the computable type $$p(x)=\{x&gt;\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{n\text{-times}}\mid n\in\mathbb N\}.$$ Computable saturation was introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;#BarwiseSchlipf:recursiveSaturation&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's call a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ &lt;em&gt;$\omega$-nonstandard&lt;/em&gt; if it has nonstandard natural numbers. In the model theory of $\omega$-nonstandard models of ${\rm ZFC}$ (as in the model theory of nonstandard models of ${\rm PA}$) one of the most important notions is the standard system introduced by Friedman in &lt;a href=&quot;#friedman:countableModelsOfSetTheory&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;standard system &lt;/em&gt; of an $\omega$-nonstandard model of ${\rm ZFC}$ is a collection of subsets of $\mathbb N$ consisting of the traces of sets in $M$ on the natural numbers: $${\rm SSy}(M)=\{A\cap \mathbb N\mid A\in M\}.$$ Standard systems are clearly Boolean algebras. Standard systems are closed under computability: whenever $A$ is in it and $B$ is computable from $A$, then $B$ is in it. To see this, fix $A\in {\rm SSy}(M)$ and let $B$ be computed from $A$ by a program $p$. The set $A=A^*\cap \mathbb N$ for some $A^*\in M$ and we can assume without loss that $A^*\subseteq\mathbb N^M$. The computation of program $P$ with oracle $A^*$ inside $M$ agrees with the actual computation of $p$ with oracle $A$ on the standard part, which is $B$. In particular, it follows that a standard system has all computable sets, and so computable theories such as ${\rm PA}$ and ${\rm ZFC}$ are (coded) in the standard system. Finally, whenever a set $T$ in a standard system codes an infinite binary tree, the standard system must have some infinite branch through $T$. Such a set $T$ must have come from a set $T^*\in M$, which has to look like a binary tree up to some nonstandard level (because otherwise the true natural numbers would be definable in $M$). So we fix some node $c$ on a nonstandard level of $T^*$ and its predecessors in $T^*$ give a branch through $T$. Observe also if $M$ and $N$ are $\omega$-nonstandard models of ${\rm ZFC}$ such that $\mathbb N^M$ is an initial segment of $\mathbb N^N$, then ${\rm SSy}(M)\subseteq {\rm SSy}(N)$. The reason is that if a set $A\in {\rm SSy}(M)$, then there is a nonstandard natural number $a\in M$ such that the characteristic function of $A$ is coded on the standard part of the binary expansion of $a$, and indeed $M$ has such numbers arbitrarily low above the standard $\mathbb N$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An $\omega$-nonstandard model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is said to be &lt;em&gt;${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated&lt;/em&gt; if for every type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ (coded) in ${\rm SSy}(M)$, whenever there is $\bar a\in M$ such that $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable, then $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is realized. Since ${\rm SSy}(M)$ has all the computable sets, ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated models are computably saturated. But the converse holds as well. To see this, fix a type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ in ${\rm SSy}(M)$ and let $A\in M$ such that $A\cap\mathbb N=\{\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\mid \varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)\}$. Suppose that for $\bar a\in M$, $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable. Consider the computable type $$p^*(\bar x,\bar y,z)=\{\varphi(\bar x,\bar y)\leftrightarrow \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in z\mid \varphi\text{ is a formula}\}.$$ Since $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable, then so is $p^*(\bar x,\bar a,A)$, but the realization of $p^*(\bar x,\bar a,A)$ also realizes $p(\bar x,\bar a)$. Standard system saturation was introduced by Wilmers in an unpublished 1975 thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can use standard system saturation to show several key properties of computably saturated models. The standard system of a computably saturated model has all the types of its elements ($\text{tp}^M(\bar a)$ for $\bar a\in M$), and in particular its theory. Suppose $M$ is ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated and $\bar a\in M$. We need to show that there is $A\in M$ such that $A\cap \mathbb N=\{\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\mid M\models\varphi(\bar a)\}$. Consider the computable type $$p(x,\bar y)=\{\varphi(\bar y)\leftrightarrow \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in\bar x\mid\varphi\text{ is a formula}\}.$$ Since $M$ has $\Sigma_n$-truth predicates for every true natural number $n$, $p(x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable in $M$, and thus there is $A\in M$ realizing $p(\bar x,\bar a)$. Once we have that all types are in the standard system, we obtain a remarkable characterization of countable computably saturated models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: Countable computably saturated models $M$ and $N$ of ${\rm ZFC}$ are isomorphic if and only if they have the same theory and the same standard system. Indeed, if $\text{tp}^M(\bar a)=\text{tp}^N(\bar b)$, then there is an isomorphism taking $\bar a$ to $\bar b$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a back-and-forth argument. Let's extend the partial isomorphism taking $\bar a$ to $\bar b$ one more step. Fix $c\in M$. Then $\text{tp}(c,\bar a)\in {\rm SSy}(M)={\rm SSy}(N)$ and $p(x,\bar y)=\{\varphi(x,\bar y)\mid \varphi\in \text{tp}(x,\bar y)\}$ is finitely realizable in $N$. Thus, by standard system saturation, there is $d\in N$ such that $\text{tp}(c,\bar a)=\text{tp}(d,\bar b)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Corollary&lt;/strong&gt;: Countable computably saturated models $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ have many automorphisms. Whenever $a,b\in M$ are such that $\text{tp}(a)=\text{tp}(b)$, then there is an automorphism of $M$ taking $a$ to $b$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ arise naturally as follows. If $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is an element of an $\omega$-nonstandard model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then $M$ is computably saturated. To see this, fix a computable type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ and a tuple $\bar a\in M$ such that $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable. Also fix a set $A\in N$ such that $A\cap \mathbb N$ codes $p(\bar x,\bar y)$. Since $M$ is a set in $N$, $N$ has a truth predicate for $M$, which by absoluteness of satisfaction must be correct for standard formulas. The model $N$ sees, for every true natural number $n$, that $M$ realizes all $\varphi(\bar x,\bar a)$ such that $\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in A\cap n$. But then there must be some nonstandard $c\in N$ such that $N$ thinks that $M$ realizes all $\varphi(\bar x,\bar a)$ such that $\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in A\cap c$. Any such realization $\bar b$ realizes $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ because $A\cap c$ includes all standard assertions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some other remarkable results about computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt;: Every computably saturated model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ has an elementary rank initial segment $V_\alpha^M\prec M$ &lt;a href=&quot;#Ressayre:recursiveSaturation&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider the computable type $p(x)$ consisting of assertions $$\forall \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in\Sigma_n\,\text{Tr}_{\Sigma_n}(\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner)\leftrightarrow \text{Tr}_{\Delta_0}(\ulcorner x\models\varphi\urcorner)$$ for every $n$ (where $\text{Tr}_{\Sigma_n}$ is a $\Sigma_n$-truth predicate) together with the assertion 
&quot;$x$ is a rank initial segment&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following observation was the key to our theorem with Joel Hamkins that the collection of all countable computably saturated models satisfies the Hamkins Multiverse Axioms &lt;a href=&quot;#multiverse:gitmanhamkins&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt; Every countable computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ has an isomorphic copy of itself as an element which it thinks is countable and $\omega$-nonstandard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose $N$ is countable and computably saturated. The theory $\mathcal T$ of $N$ is in ${\rm SSy}(N)$ and so we can fix a theory $\mathcal T^*\in N$ such that $\mathcal T^*\cap\mathbb N=\mathcal T$. The model $N$ sees that $\mathcal T^*\cap n$ is consistent for every true natural number $n$ and therefore $N$ has some nonstandard natural number $c$ such that it thinks that $\mathcal T^*\cap c$ is consistent. Thus, $N$ has a model of $\mathcal T^*\cap c$. But then $N$ also thinks that $\mathcal T^*\cap c$ also has an $\omega$-nonstandard model $M$. Since $\mathbb N^N$ is an initial segment of $\mathbb N^M$, the two models have the same standard system and by construction they have the same theory. Therefore $M\cong N$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the final result I want to mention, let's recall that a &lt;em&gt;truth predicate&lt;/em&gt; for an $\omega$-nonstandard model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is a subset $T\subseteq M$ such that in the structure $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$, $T$ satisfies the Tarskian truth conditions for $\langle M,\in\rangle$. In particular, $T$ must be a truth predicate for standard formulas. A set $T\subseteq M$ is a &lt;em&gt;partial truth predicate&lt;/em&gt; if in $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$, there is a nonstandard number $c$ such that $T$ restricted to formulas of length less than $c$ satisfies Tarskian truth conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: The following are equivalent for a countable $\omega$-nonstandard $M\models{\rm ZFC}$.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $M$ is computably saturated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $M$ has a partial truth predicate $T$ such that $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$ satisfies ${\rm ZFC}$ in the extended language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $M$ has a truth predicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same result for models of ${\rm PA}$ was shown by Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan &lt;a href=&quot;#KotlarskiKrajewskiLachlan:fullSatisfactionClass&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#Lachlan:fullSatisfactionClass&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;. In his dissertation Bartosz Wcisło showed that a truth predicate can be used to define a partial truth predicate preserving ${\rm PA}$ and Michał Godzisgewski observed that with this new result the theorem extends to models of ${\rm ZFC}$. Note that it is impossible to extend condition $(3)$ to say that $\langle M,\in,T\rangle\models{\rm ZFC}$ because any such $M$ would be a model of $\text{Con}({\rm ZFC})$.&lt;/p&gt;

A type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ in $\mathcal L$ is said to be computable if the collection of Gödel codes of the formulas in the type $$\{\ulcorner \varphi\urcorner\mid \varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)\}$$ is a computable set. A model $M$ of $\mathcal L$ is said to be computably saturated if for every tuple $\bar a\in M$ and every computable type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$, whenever $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable in $M$, then $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is realized: there is a tuple $\bar b\in M$ such that for every $\varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)$, $M\models\varphi(\bar b,\bar a)$. It is not difficult to see that any model $M$ of cardinality $\kappa$ has a computably saturated elementary extension of cardinality $\kappa$. We build the elementary extension in $\omega$-many steps, at each step realizing all finitely realizable computable types with parameters from the previous stage. Observe that any computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ must have nonstandard natural numbers because it realizes the computable type $$p(x)=\{x&gt;\underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{n\text{-times}}\mid n\in\mathbb N\}.$$ Computable saturation was introduced in {% cite BarwiseSchlipf:recursiveSaturation %}. Let's call a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ $\omega$-nonstandard if it has nonstandard natural numbers. In the model theory of $\omega$-nonstandard models of ${\rm ZFC}$ (as in the model theory of nonstandard models of ${\rm PA}$) one of the most important notions is the standard system introduced by Friedman in {% cite friedman:countableModelsOfSetTheory %}. The standard system of an $\omega$-nonstandard model of ${\rm ZFC}$ is a collection of subsets of $\mathbb N$ consisting of the traces of sets in $M$ on the natural numbers: $${\rm SSy}(M)=\{A\cap \mathbb N\mid A\in M\}.$$ Standard systems are clearly Boolean algebras. Standard systems are closed under computability: whenever $A$ is in it and $B$ is computable from $A$, then $B$ is in it. To see this, fix $A\in {\rm SSy}(M)$ and let $B$ be computed from $A$ by a program $p$. The set $A=A^*\cap \mathbb N$ for some $A^*\in M$ and we can assume without loss that $A^*\subseteq\mathbb N^M$. The computation of program $P$ with oracle $A^*$ inside $M$ agrees with the actual computation of $p$ with oracle $A$ on the standard part, which is $B$. In particular, it follows that a standard system has all computable sets, and so computable theories such as ${\rm PA}$ and ${\rm ZFC}$ are (coded) in the standard system. Finally, whenever a set $T$ in a standard system codes an infinite binary tree, the standard system must have some infinite branch through $T$. Such a set $T$ must have come from a set $T^*\in M$, which has to look like a binary tree up to some nonstandard level (because otherwise the true natural numbers would be definable in $M$). So we fix some node $c$ on a nonstandard level of $T^*$ and its predecessors in $T^*$ give a branch through $T$. Observe also if $M$ and $N$ are $\omega$-nonstandard models of ${\rm ZFC}$ such that $\mathbb N^M$ is an initial segment of $\mathbb N^N$, then ${\rm SSy}(M)\subseteq {\rm SSy}(N)$. The reason is that if a set $A\in {\rm SSy}(M)$, then there is a nonstandard natural number $a\in M$ such that the characteristic function of $A$ is coded on the standard part of the binary expansion of $a$, and indeed $M$ has such numbers arbitrarily low above the standard $\mathbb N$. An $\omega$-nonstandard model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is said to be ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated if for every type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ (coded) in ${\rm SSy}(M)$, whenever there is $\bar a\in M$ such that $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable, then $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is realized. Since ${\rm SSy}(M)$ has all the computable sets, ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated models are computably saturated. But the converse holds as well. To see this, fix a type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ in ${\rm SSy}(M)$ and let $A\in M$ such that $A\cap\mathbb N=\{\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\mid \varphi\in p(\bar x,\bar y)\}$. Suppose that for $\bar a\in M$, $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable. Consider the computable type $$p^*(\bar x,\bar y,z)=\{\varphi(\bar x,\bar y)\leftrightarrow \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in z\mid \varphi\text{ is a formula}\}.$$ Since $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable, then so is $p^*(\bar x,\bar a,A)$, but the realization of $p^*(\bar x,\bar a,A)$ also realizes $p(\bar x,\bar a)$. Standard system saturation was introduced by Wilmers in an unpublished 1975 thesis. We can use standard system saturation to show several key properties of computably saturated models. The standard system of a computably saturated model has all the types of its elements ($\text{tp}^M(\bar a)$ for $\bar a\in M$), and in particular its theory. Suppose $M$ is ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated and $\bar a\in M$. We need to show that there is $A\in M$ such that $A\cap \mathbb N=\{\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\mid M\models\varphi(\bar a)\}$. Consider the computable type $$p(x,\bar y)=\{\varphi(\bar y)\leftrightarrow \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in\bar x\mid\varphi\text{ is a formula}\}.$$ Since $M$ has $\Sigma_n$-truth predicates for every true natural number $n$, $p(x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable in $M$, and thus there is $A\in M$ realizing $p(\bar x,\bar a)$. Once we have that all types are in the standard system, we obtain a remarkable characterization of countable computably saturated models. Theorem: Countable computably saturated models $M$ and $N$ of ${\rm ZFC}$ are isomorphic if and only if they have the same theory and the same standard system. Indeed, if $\text{tp}^M(\bar a)=\text{tp}^N(\bar b)$, then there is an isomorphism taking $\bar a$ to $\bar b$. Proof: This is a back-and-forth argument. Let's extend the partial isomorphism taking $\bar a$ to $\bar b$ one more step. Fix $c\in M$. Then $\text{tp}(c,\bar a)\in {\rm SSy}(M)={\rm SSy}(N)$ and $p(x,\bar y)=\{\varphi(x,\bar y)\mid \varphi\in \text{tp}(x,\bar y)\}$ is finitely realizable in $N$. Thus, by standard system saturation, there is $d\in N$ such that $\text{tp}(c,\bar a)=\text{tp}(d,\bar b)$. Corollary: Countable computably saturated models $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ have many automorphisms. Whenever $a,b\in M$ are such that $\text{tp}(a)=\text{tp}(b)$, then there is an automorphism of $M$ taking $a$ to $b$. Computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ arise naturally as follows. If $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is an element of an $\omega$-nonstandard model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then $M$ is computably saturated. To see this, fix a computable type $p(\bar x,\bar y)$ and a tuple $\bar a\in M$ such that $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable. Also fix a set $A\in N$ such that $A\cap \mathbb N$ codes $p(\bar x,\bar y)$. Since $M$ is a set in $N$, $N$ has a truth predicate for $M$, which by absoluteness of satisfaction must be correct for standard formulas. The model $N$ sees, for every true natural number $n$, that $M$ realizes all $\varphi(\bar x,\bar a)$ such that $\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in A\cap n$. But then there must be some nonstandard $c\in N$ such that $N$ thinks that $M$ realizes all $\varphi(\bar x,\bar a)$ such that $\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in A\cap c$. Any such realization $\bar b$ realizes $p(\bar x,\bar a)$ because $A\cap c$ includes all standard assertions. Here are some other remarkable results about computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$. Theorem:: Every computably saturated model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ has an elementary rank initial segment $V_\alpha^M\prec M$ {% cite Ressayre:recursiveSaturation %}. Proof: Consider the computable type $p(x)$ consisting of assertions $$\forall \ulcorner\varphi\urcorner\in\Sigma_n\,\text{Tr}_{\Sigma_n}(\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner)\leftrightarrow \text{Tr}_{\Delta_0}(\ulcorner x\models\varphi\urcorner)$$ for every $n$ (where $\text{Tr}_{\Sigma_n}$ is a $\Sigma_n$-truth predicate) together with the assertion &quot;$x$ is a rank initial segment&quot;. The following observation was the key to our theorem with Joel Hamkins that the collection of all countable computably saturated models satisfies the Hamkins Multiverse Axioms {% cite multiverse:gitmanhamkins %}. Theorem: Every countable computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ has an isomorphic copy of itself as an element which it thinks is countable and $\omega$-nonstandard. Proof: Suppose $N$ is countable and computably saturated. The theory $\mathcal T$ of $N$ is in ${\rm SSy}(N)$ and so we can fix a theory $\mathcal T^*\in N$ such that $\mathcal T^*\cap\mathbb N=\mathcal T$. The model $N$ sees that $\mathcal T^*\cap n$ is consistent for every true natural number $n$ and therefore $N$ has some nonstandard natural number $c$ such that it thinks that $\mathcal T^*\cap c$ is consistent. Thus, $N$ has a model of $\mathcal T^*\cap c$. But then $N$ also thinks that $\mathcal T^*\cap c$ also has an $\omega$-nonstandard model $M$. Since $\mathbb N^N$ is an initial segment of $\mathbb N^M$, the two models have the same standard system and by construction they have the same theory. Therefore $M\cong N$. For the final result I want to mention, let's recall that a truth predicate for an $\omega$-nonstandard model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is a subset $T\subseteq M$ such that in the structure $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$, $T$ satisfies the Tarskian truth conditions for $\langle M,\in\rangle$. In particular, $T$ must be a truth predicate for standard formulas. A set $T\subseteq M$ is a partial truth predicate if in $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$, there is a nonstandard number $c$ such that $T$ restricted to formulas of length less than $c$ satisfies Tarskian truth conditions. Theorem: The following are equivalent for a countable $\omega$-nonstandard $M\models{\rm ZFC}$. $M$ is computably saturated. $M$ has a partial truth predicate $T$ such that $\langle M,\in,T\rangle$ satisfies ${\rm ZFC}$ in the extended language. $M$ has a truth predicate. The same result for models of ${\rm PA}$ was shown by Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan {% cite KotlarskiKrajewskiLachlan:fullSatisfactionClass %}, {% cite Lachlan:fullSatisfactionClass %}. In his dissertation Bartosz Wcisło showed that a truth predicate can be used to define a partial truth predicate preserving ${\rm PA}$ and Michał Godzisgewski observed that with this new result the theorem extends to models of ${\rm ZFC}$. Note that it is impossible to extend condition $(3)$ to say that $\langle M,\in,T\rangle\models{\rm ZFC}$ because any such $M$ would be a model of $\text{Con}({\rm ZFC})$.

I have to admit that I always thought completely ineffable cardinals to be a rather boring technical notion. But I recently came across several equivalent characterizations of complete ineffability that are quite surprising and natural. I also think I stumbled upon an interesting consistency strength implication from completely ineffable cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Completely ineffable cardinals sit atop the ineffability hierarchy. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;ineffable&lt;/em&gt; if every coloring $f:[\kappa]^2\to 2$, coloring pairs of ordinals in 2 colors, has a stationary homogeneous subset. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;$n$-ineffable&lt;/em&gt; if every coloring $f:[\kappa]^n\to 2$ has a stationary homogeneous subset. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;totally ineffable&lt;/em&gt; if it is $n$-ineffable for every $n$. It is not easy to remember the definition of completely ineffable cardinals. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;completely ineffable&lt;/em&gt; if there is a collection $\mathcal R$ of stationary subsets of $\kappa$ closed under supersets such that every coloring $f:[A]^2\to 2$ for $A\in\mathcal R$ has a homogeneous subset in $\mathcal R$. So a completely ineffable $\kappa$ has a set of stationary subsets of $\kappa$ that is closed under the operation of obtaining homogeneous sets for colorings. Completely ineffable cardinals are limits of totally ineffable cardinals. They are also totally indescribable. Completely ineffable cardinals lie relatively low in the large cardinal hierarchy. They are much weaker than Ramsey or even $\omega$-Erdos cardinals, in particular, they can exist in $L$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I call a transitive model $M\models{\rm ZFC}^-$ (${\rm ZFC}$ with the powerset axiom removed) a &lt;em&gt;weak $\kappa$-model&lt;/em&gt; if it has size $\kappa$ and $\kappa\in M$. Many of the smaller large cardinals, those below a measurable cardinal, have characterizations in terms of existence of elementary embeddings of weak $\kappa$-models. For example, $\kappa$ is weakly compact if (it is inaccessible and) every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and $N$ transitive. Equivalently, every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ with a well-founded ultrapower. An &lt;em&gt;$M$-ultrafilter&lt;/em&gt; on $\kappa$ is an ultrafilter on $P(\kappa)^M$, not necessarily from $M$, that is normal for sequences from $M$. A well-founded ultrapower by an $M$-ultrafilter yields an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and conversely given an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and $N$ transitive, we have that $$U=\{A\in M\mid A\subseteq\kappa\text{ and }\kappa\in j(A)\}$$ is an $M$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower (the ultrapower embeds into $N$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although we can take the ultrapower by an $M$-ultrafilter, we cannot necessarily iterate the ultrapower construction. If $U$ is not in $M$, how do we define $j(U)$? It turns out that you can do this if the $M$-ultrafilter has the additional property of being weakly amenable, that is being partially internal to $M$. An $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;weakly amenable&lt;/em&gt; if for every $A\in M$ which $M$ thinks has size $\kappa$, $A\cap U\in M$. A well-founded ultrapower $j:M\to N$ by a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ has the property that $P(\kappa)^M=P(\kappa)^N$ and if $j:M\to N$ is any embedding with critical point $\kappa$ such that $P(\kappa)^M=P(\kappa)^N$, then the derived $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (defined as above) is weakly amenable. In my dissertation, I introduced the $\alpha$-iterability hierarchy by exploring iterability properties of weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilters. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;1-iterable&lt;/em&gt; if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower. More generally, a cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;$\alpha$-iterable&lt;/em&gt; for $1\leq\alpha\leq\omega_1$ if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter with $\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers (once you have $\omega_1$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers, then all the rest are well-founded as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The point here is that a $1$-iterable cardinal $\kappa$ is a already a limit of completely ineffable cardinals. To see this, let $M$ be a weak $\kappa$-model with $V_\kappa\in M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ with a well-founded ultrapower. First, let's argue that for every $A\in U$ and coloring $f:[A]^2\to 2$ in $M$, there is a homogeneous set for $f$ in $U$. Let $h:M\to K$ be the (possibly ill-founded) ultrapower by $U\times U$, which exists by weak amenability. It is still the case that $A\subseteq \kappa\times\kappa$ is in $U\times U$ if and only if $[\text{id}]_{U\times U}\in h(A)$. Say $h(f)([\text{id}]_{U\times U})=1$. Then $$A=\{(\xi_1,\xi_2)\mid f(\xi_1,\xi_2)=1\}\in U\times U.$$ An easy argument shows that whenever $X\in U\times U$, then there is a set $\bar X\in U$ such that for all $\xi_1&lt;\xi_2$ in $\bar X$, $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in X$. So $U$ has a set $\bar A$ such that whenever $\xi_1&lt;\xi_2$ are in $\bar A$, then $(\xi_1,\xi_2)\in A$, and so $f(\xi_1,\xi_2)=1$, meaning that $\bar A$ is homogeneous for $f$. Now let $j:M\to N$ be the ultrapower by $U$. We will argue that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable in $N$, and hence by elementarity $M$ thinks that $\kappa$ is a limit of completely ineffable cardinals, but it must be correct about it because it has the true $V_\kappa$. We work now inside $N$. Let $\mathcal R_0$ be the collection of all stationary subsets of $\kappa$. Given $R_\xi$, let $R_{\xi+1}$ be the collection of all sets $A$ in $R_\xi$ such that for every coloring $f:[A]^2\to 2$, $R_\xi$ has a homogeneous set for $A$. At limits take intersections. There must be some $\theta$ such that $R_\theta=R_{\theta+1}$ and if $R_\theta$ is not empty, then by construction it will witness that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable. But this is the case because $U\subseteq R_\xi$ for every $\xi$. Note though that a 1-iterable cardinals may not be completely ineffable itself because it is $\Pi^1_2$-describable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next, let's talk about one of the game Ramsey cardinals introduced by Holy and Schlicht in &lt;a href=&quot;#HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. First, let's modify the definition of a weak $\kappa$-model to allow &lt;em&gt;non-transitive&lt;/em&gt; $\in$-models. We need this because we want to consider models of size $\kappa$ elementary in large $H_\theta$ (collection of all sets whose transitive closure has size less than $\theta$). Let's call a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ a &lt;em&gt;$\kappa$-model&lt;/em&gt; if it is closed under sequences of length less than $\kappa$. Now fix an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ and a regular cardinal $\theta&gt;\kappa$. Consider a two player game of perfect information of length $\omega$ between the challenger and the judge, where at each step $n$ of the game, the challenger plays a $\kappa$-model $M_n\prec H_\theta$ and the judge responds with an $M_n$-ultrafilter $U_n$. Additionally, at each step the challenger needs to make sure that $M_n\subseteq M_{n+1}$ and $M_n,U_n\cap M_n\in M_{n+1}$. The judge wins the game if she is able to play for $\omega$-many steps and otherwise the challenger wins. A cardinal $\kappa$ has the &lt;em&gt;$\omega$-filter property&lt;/em&gt; if the challenger doesn't have a winning strategy for any regular $\theta$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Finally, let's talk about Paul Corazza's &lt;em&gt;Wholeness Axiom&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#corazza:wholenessAxiom&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Kunen's Inconsistency, which says that there cannot be an elementary embedding $j:V\to V$ can be formalized in several ways. The proof shows that in a model of the second-order Kelley-Morse set theory $(V,\in,\mathcal S)$ there cannot be a class $j\in \mathcal S$ which is an elementary embedding of the first-order part $(V,\in)$. We can also consider expanding the language $\{\in\}$ of set theory by a binary predicate $j$ and considering the theory ${\rm ZFC}$ in this expanded language (with separation and replacement applying to formulas with $j$) together with a scheme of assertions that $j$ is a non-trivial elementary embedding. Kunen's result can also be viewed as asserting that such a theory is inconsistent. What fragment of this theory in the language with $j$ can we salvage? Suppose we just assert that $j$ is non-trivial and elementary. This theory is equiconsistent with ${\rm ZFC}$ because if there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ that is computably saturated and hence has plenty of not just elementary embeddings, but automorphisms (see &lt;a href=&quot;/research/2019/06/04/some-cute-observations-about-computably-saturated-models/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;).  How about the theory saying that $j$ is elementary and has a critical point (meaning that some ordinal $\kappa$ is moved and every ordinal 
$\alpha&lt;\kappa$ is fixed)? Corazza calls this theory ${\rm BTEE}$ (basic theory of elementary embeddings). So there is a model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ and an elementary embedding $j:M\to M$ with critical point $\kappa\in M$. It is easy to see that $\kappa$ must be at least inaccessible in $M$. The argument we gave for 1-iterable cardinals shows that $\kappa$ is $n$-ineffable in $M$ for every natural number $n$ of the metatheory because we can use $j$ to derive an $M$-ultrafilter $U$, which must be weakly amenable, and use product ultrafilters $U^n$ to obtain homogeneous sets. If we additionally assume that $\Sigma_0$-separation holds for formulas with $j$, then it follows that $j$ is amenable to $M$ (for every $a\in M$, $j\upharpoonright a\in M$), which implies that $\kappa$ is at least super $n$-huge in $M$ for every $n\in\omega$. That's quite a jump in consistency strength! It is not known whether assuming full separation for $j$ gives a consistency-wise stronger theory although it is known that weaker and stronger separation have different consequences. Stronger separation implies for example that iterate embeddings $j^n$ are definable in $M$ for every natural number $n\in M$, but this is known to fail with just $\Sigma_0$-separation (the issues here arise for nonstandard $n$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following theorem gives several very different characterizations of completely ineffable cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;:
The following are equivalent to $\kappa$ being completely ineffable.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
(Nielsen and Welch &lt;a href=&quot;#NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;) $\kappa$ has the $\omega$-filter property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;#AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;) In a forcing extension $V[G]$, there is a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter and hence a generic elementary embedding $j:V\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ such that $V_{\kappa+1}^V=V_{\kappa+1}^N$ (it follows that $\kappa^+$ is in the well-founded part of $j$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; For every regular $\theta&gt;\kappa$, every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M\prec H_\theta$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (but the ultrapower may fail to be well-founded).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;:
For equivalence with (1) see &lt;a href=&quot;#NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. For equivalence with (2), see the the argument in &lt;a href=&quot;#AbramsonHarringtonKleinbergZwicker:FlippingProperties&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; for forcing over countable models and instead force over $V$. (3) follows from (2) by playing the game for $\omega$-many steps to build $U$. Finally suppose (3) and let's argue that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable. The same argument which shows that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable in $N$ for a 1-iterable embedding $j:M\to N$ will show that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable in $M$ and this suffices because $M\prec H_\theta$ is correct about complete ineffability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Completely ineffable cardinals now look very similar to 1-iterable cardinals, but the true analogue is actually the $\omega$-Ramsey cardinals, another game Ramsey cardinal notion of Holy and Schlicht from &lt;a href=&quot;#HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. A cardinal $\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;$\omega$-Ramsey&lt;/em&gt; if the challenger has no winning strategy in the games described as above only with the additional condition that in order for the judge to win, after the $\omega$-many steps, $U=\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}U_n$ has to have a well-founded ultrapower. Equivalently, for every regular $\theta&gt;\kappa$, every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M\prec H_\theta$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ with a well-founded ultrapower. $\omega$-Ramsey cardinals are between 1-iterable and 2-iterable cardinals in consistency strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;:
Consistency of a completely ineffable cardinal implies consistency of the theory ${\rm BTEE}$.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;:
Suppose that $\kappa$ is completely ineffable in a model $V\models{\rm ZFC}$ and move to a forcing extension $V[G]$, in which there is a generic embedding $j:V\to N$ by a weakly amenable $V$-ultrafilter $U$. Since $U$ is weakly amenable, we can iterate the ultrapower construction $\omega$-many times, obtaining iterate embeddings $j_{mn}:N_m\to N_n$ with critical point $\kappa_n$. Let $\mathcal N$ be the direct limit of this system. Standard arguments show that the critical sequence $\{\kappa_n\mid n&lt;\omega\}$ are indiscernibles for $\mathcal N$ even for formulas with parameters $\alpha&lt;\kappa$. (Note that $V_{\kappa+1}^{\mathcal N}=V_{\kappa+1}^V$.) Now let $M$ be generated in $\mathcal N$ by $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ and the critical sequence $\kappa_n$ for $n&lt;\omega$. Define $h:M\to M$ to be the elementary embedding generated by the shift of indiscernibles map taking $\kappa_n$ to $\kappa_{n+1}$. In other words, a term $t(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_n,\kappa_0,\ldots,\kappa_m)$, with $\alpha_i&lt;\kappa$, gets mapped to the term $t(\alpha_0,\ldots\alpha_n,\kappa_1,\ldots,\kappa_{n+1})$. Because the $\kappa_n$ are indiscernibles for formulas with parameters $\alpha&lt;\kappa$, $h$ is a well-defined elementary embedding with critical point $\kappa=\kappa_0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This squizes the consistency strength of ${\rm BTEE}$ between $n$-ineffable cardinals for every $n$ and completely ineffable cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;

But I recently came across several equivalent characterizations of complete ineffability that are quite surprising and natural. I also think I stumbled upon an interesting consistency strength implication from completely ineffable cardinals. Completely ineffable cardinals sit atop the ineffability hierarchy. A cardinal $\kappa$ is ineffable if every coloring $f:[\kappa]^2\to 2$, coloring pairs of ordinals in 2 colors, has a stationary homogeneous subset. A cardinal $\kappa$ is $n$-ineffable if every coloring $f:[\kappa]^n\to 2$ has a stationary homogeneous subset. A cardinal $\kappa$ is totally ineffable if it is $n$-ineffable for every $n$. It is not easy to remember the definition of completely ineffable cardinals. A cardinal $\kappa$ is completely ineffable if there is a collection $\mathcal R$ of stationary subsets of $\kappa$ closed under supersets such that every coloring $f:[A]^2\to 2$ for $A\in\mathcal R$ has a homogeneous subset in $\mathcal R$. So a completely ineffable $\kappa$ has a set of stationary subsets of $\kappa$ that is closed under the operation of obtaining homogeneous sets for colorings. Completely ineffable cardinals are limits of totally ineffable cardinals. They are also totally indescribable. Completely ineffable cardinals lie relatively low in the large cardinal hierarchy. They are much weaker than Ramsey or even $\omega$-Erdos cardinals, in particular, they can exist in $L$. I call a transitive model $M\models{\rm ZFC}^-$ (${\rm ZFC}$ with the powerset axiom removed) a weak $\kappa$-model if it has size $\kappa$ and $\kappa\in M$. Many of the smaller large cardinals, those below a measurable cardinal, have characterizations in terms of existence of elementary embeddings of weak $\kappa$-models. For example, $\kappa$ is weakly compact if (it is inaccessible and) every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and $N$ transitive. Equivalently, every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ with a well-founded ultrapower. An $M$-ultrafilter on $\kappa$ is an ultrafilter on $P(\kappa)^M$, not necessarily from $M$, that is normal for sequences from $M$. A well-founded ultrapower by an $M$-ultrafilter yields an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and conversely given an elementary embedding $j:M\to N$ with critical point $\kappa$ and $N$ transitive, we have that $$U=\{A\in M\mid A\subseteq\kappa\text{ and }\kappa\in j(A)\}$$ is an $M$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower (the ultrapower embeds into $N$). Although we can take the ultrapower by an $M$-ultrafilter, we cannot necessarily iterate the ultrapower construction. If $U$ is not in $M$, how do we define $j(U)$? It turns out that you can do this if the $M$-ultrafilter has the additional property of being weakly amenable, that is being partially internal to $M$. An $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ is weakly amenable if for every $A\in M$ which $M$ thinks has size $\kappa$, $A\cap U\in M$. A well-founded ultrapower $j:M\to N$ by a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ on $\kappa$ has the property that $P(\kappa)^M=P(\kappa)^N$ and if $j:M\to N$ is any embedding with critical point $\kappa$ such that $P(\kappa)^M=P(\kappa)^N$, then the derived $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (defined as above) is weakly amenable. In my dissertation, I introduced the $\alpha$-iterability hierarchy by exploring iterability properties of weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilters. A cardinal $\kappa$ is 1-iterable if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter with a well-founded ultrapower. More generally, a cardinal $\kappa$ is $\alpha$-iterable for $1\leq\alpha\leq\omega_1$ if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter with $\alpha$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers (once you have $\omega_1$-many well-founded iterated ultrapowers, then all the rest are well-founded as well). The point here is that a $1$-iterable cardinal $\kappa$ is a already a limit of completely ineffable cardinals. To see this, let $M$ be a weak $\kappa$-model with $V_\kappa\in M$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ with a well-founded ultrapower. First, let's argue that for every $A\in U$ and coloring $f:[A]^2\to 2$ in $M$, there is a homogeneous set for $f$ in $U$. Let $h:M\to K$ be the (possibly ill-founded) ultrapower by $U\times U$, which exists by weak amenability. It is still the case that $A\subseteq \kappa\times\kappa$ is in $U\times U$ if and only if $[\text{id}]_{U\times U}\in h(A)$. Say $h(f)([\text{id}]_{U\times U})=1$. Then $$A=\{(\xi_1,\xi_2)\mid f(\xi_1,\xi_2)=1\}\in U\times U.$$ An easy argument shows that whenever $X\in U\times U$, then there is a set $\bar X\in U$ such that for all $\xi_1 Next, let's talk about one of the game Ramsey cardinals introduced by Holy and Schlicht in {% cite HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals %}. First, let's modify the definition of a weak $\kappa$-model to allow non-transitive $\in$-models. We need this because we want to consider models of size $\kappa$ elementary in large $H_\theta$ (collection of all sets whose transitive closure has size less than $\theta$). Let's call a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ a $\kappa$-model if it is closed under sequences of length less than $\kappa$. Now fix an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ and a regular cardinal $\theta&gt;\kappa$. Consider a two player game of perfect information of length $\omega$ between the challenger and the judge, where at each step $n$ of the game, the challenger plays a $\kappa$-model $M_n\prec H_\theta$ and the judge responds with an $M_n$-ultrafilter $U_n$. Additionally, at each step the challenger needs to make sure that $M_n\subseteq M_{n+1}$ and $M_n,U_n\cap M_n\in M_{n+1}$. The judge wins the game if she is able to play for $\omega$-many steps and otherwise the challenger wins. A cardinal $\kappa$ has the $\omega$-filter property if the challenger doesn't have a winning strategy for any regular $\theta$. Finally, let's talk about Paul Corazza's Wholeness Axiom {% cite corazza:wholenessAxiom %}. Kunen's Inconsistency, which says that there cannot be an elementary embedding $j:V\to V$ can be formalized in several ways. The proof shows that in a model of the second-order Kelley-Morse set theory $(V,\in,\mathcal S)$ there cannot be a class $j\in \mathcal S$ which is an elementary embedding of the first-order part $(V,\in)$. We can also consider expanding the language $\{\in\}$ of set theory by a binary predicate $j$ and considering the theory ${\rm ZFC}$ in this expanded language (with separation and replacement applying to formulas with $j$) together with a scheme of assertions that $j$ is a non-trivial elementary embedding. Kunen's result can also be viewed as asserting that such a theory is inconsistent. What fragment of this theory in the language with $j$ can we salvage? Suppose we just assert that $j$ is non-trivial and elementary. This theory is equiconsistent with ${\rm ZFC}$ because if there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, then there is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ that is computably saturated and hence has plenty of not just elementary embeddings, but automorphisms (see this post). How about the theory saying that $j$ is elementary and has a critical point (meaning that some ordinal $\kappa$ is moved and every ordinal $\alpha The following theorem gives several very different characterizations of completely ineffable cardinals. Theorem: The following are equivalent to $\kappa$ being completely ineffable. (Nielsen and Welch {% cite NielsenWelch:GamesAndRamseyLikeCardinals %}) $\kappa$ has the $\omega$-filter property.

For every regular $\theta&gt;\kappa$, every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M\prec H_\theta$ for which there is a weakly amenable $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (but the ultrapower may fail to be well-founded).

A model of a first-order theory $T$ is said to be &lt;em&gt;computably saturated&lt;/em&gt; (old fashioned terminology is: recursively saturated) if it satisfies all its finitely realizable computable types (in finitely many parameters). A type $p(x,\bar y)$ is &lt;em&gt;computable&lt;/em&gt; if the set of Gödel codes of the formulas in it is computable. A type $p(x,\bar a)$ is finitely realizable over a model $M$ with parameters $\bar a\in M$ if for every finite set $A$ of formulas from $p(\bar a,x)$, there is some $b\in M$ such that $\varphi(b,\bar a)$ holds in $M$ for every $\varphi(x,\bar y )\in A$.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am particularly interested in computably saturated models of my two favorite theories Peano Arithmetic ${\rm PA}$ and set theory ${\rm ZFC}$. These models have many remarkable properties. For instance, countable computably saturated models have plenty of automorphisms. If $M\models{\rm PA}$ is a countable computably saturated model and $a\in M$ is not definable, then there is an automorphism which moves $a$. Indeed, given two elements $a$ and $b$ of the same type in $M$, there is an automorphism of $M$ moving $a$ to $b$. Also, if $a'$ is not definable from $a$ in $M$, then there is an automorphism fixing $a$, but moving $a'$. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As an example, let's argue that if $a$ is not definable, then there there is $b\neq a$ with the same type as $a$. For this we need to recall the notion of a standard system ${\rm SSy}(M)$ of $M$. The standard system is a collection of subsets of the (actual) natural numbers $\mathbb N$ that arise as intersections of $\mathbb N$ with definable (with parameters) sets of $M$: $${\rm SSy}(M)=\{A\subseteq\mathbb N\mid A=B\cap \mathbb N\text{ for some definable }B\subseteq M\}.$$ It is not difficult to see that a computably saturated model $M$ is ${\rm SSy}(M)$-&lt;em&gt;saturated&lt;/em&gt; - saturated for every type (coded) in the standard system. Conversely, if $M$ is computably saturated, then ${\rm tp}(a)$, the type of $a$, is in ${\rm SSy}(M)$ for every $a\in M$. Now consider the type $p(x,a)$ consisting of formulas in ${\rm tp}(a)$ together with the assertion $x\neq a$. Clearly $p(x,y)$ is in the standard system, since ${\rm tp}(a)$ is. So it suffices to argue that it is finitely realizable, but this follows trivially from the fact that $a$ is not definable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All the same machinery works for computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ In particular, computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ have lots of automoprhisms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaf2019nyc.com/&quot;&gt;JAF meeting&lt;/a&gt;, we were chatting about automorphisms of computably saturated models with Roman Kossak and 
Michał Godziszewski, when the following cute question came up. Is it possible to have a countable computably saturated model $M$ of ${\rm ZFC}$ such that every automorphism of its natural numbers $\mathbb N^M$ extends to an automorphism of $M$? Note that $\mathbb N^M$ must be computably saturated because $M$ is, so it has many automorphisms. We thought about it some more with Corey Switzer and finally realized that this is not possible. My guess is that this is all folklore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;
Suppose $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is a countable computably saturated model, then there is an automorphism of $\mathbb N^M$ that does not extend to an automorphism of $M$. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;:
Fix any nonstandard natural number $a\in M$. The model $M$ thinks that there is a least number $a'$ above all numbers definable over $\mathbb N^M$ by formulas of length less than $a$. In particular, it must be the case that $a'$ is not definable from $a$ because $M$ is correct about satisfaction for standard formulas over $\mathbb N^M$ and $a$ was chosen to be nonstandard. Thus, there is an automorphism of $\mathbb N^M$ which fixes $a$ but moves $a'$. But this automorphism cannot extend to $M$ because over $M$ $a'$ is definable from $a$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The above result holds with $\mathbb N^M$ replaced by any computably saturated substructure of $M$ that is a set in $M$ because all the proof used was that $M$ has a satisfaction relation for $\mathbb N^M$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Another random question that came up in the discussion, curtesy of Corey, was whether a non-computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ can have its natural numbers be computably saturated. The answer is easily seen to be yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;:
There is a model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ which is not computably saturated, but its natural numbers are computably saturated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;:
Suppose $\bar M\models{\rm ZFC}+V={\rm HOD}$ (without getting into technicalities, $V={\rm HOD}$, the assertion that every set is hereditarily ordinal definable, says that $M$ has a definable well-ordering, and hence definable Skolem functions) is computably saturated. So $\mathbb N^{\bar M}$ is computably saturated as well. Now let $M={\rm Scl}(\mathbb N^{\bar M})$ be the Skolem closure in $\bar M$ of the set of its natural numbers. It is not difficult to see that $M$ cannot be computably saturated. Consider the type $p(x,\omega)$ (using the single parameter $\omega\in M$) asserting that $x$ is an ordinal and for every formula $\varphi(y,z)$ asserting that for every $n\in\omega$, if there is a unique $z$ such that $\varphi(n,z)$, then $x&gt;z$. Clearly $p(x,\omega)$ is computable and finitely realizable in $M$, but it is not realized by the definition of $M$.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Roman Kossak claims, but I don't know the argument, that we can even construct such $M$ to be rigid (meaning that it would have no automorphisms), and hence very far from computably saturated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;
Thanks Kameryn Williams for pointing out the following result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: Suppose $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is non-standard. Then $\mathbb N^M$ is computably saturated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Proof&lt;/strong&gt;: By a classical theorem of Lachlan, having a full satisfaction class implies computable saturation &lt;a href=&quot;#Lachlan:fullSatisfactionClass&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;
A full satisfaction class is the ${\rm PA}$ terminology for a truth predicate - a subset of the model consisting of Gödel codes of formulas (including non-standard formulas) satisfying Tarskian truth conditions. A truth predicate gives a coherent definition of what is true in the model including a truth interpretation for non-standard formulas. Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan showed a partial converse that a countable computably saturated model always has a full satisfaction class &lt;a href=&quot;#KotlarskiKrajewskiLachlan:fullSatisfactionClass&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An excellent source on everything you need to know about computably saturated models of ${\rm PA}$ is Roman's and Jim Schmerl's book &lt;a href=&quot;#kossakschmerl:modelsofpa&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Most results there generalize to computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$, but there is not one good definitive source for results on these models, although people including myself, Joel Hamkins and Michał have written papers about them. See for example, &lt;a href=&quot;#HamkinsYang:SatisfactionIsNotAbsolute&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#multiverse:gitmanhamkins&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; for interesting constructions with computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$. &lt;/p&gt;

The standard system is a collection of subsets of the (actual) natural numbers $\mathbb N$ that arise as intersections of $\mathbb N$ with definable (with parameters) sets of $M$: $${\rm SSy}(M)=\{A\subseteq\mathbb N\mid A=B\cap \mathbb N\text{ for some definable }B\subseteq M\}.$$ It is not difficult to see that a computably saturated model $M$ is ${\rm SSy}(M)$-saturated - saturated for every type (coded) in the standard system. Conversely, if $M$ is computably saturated, then ${\rm tp}(a)$, the type of $a$, is in ${\rm SSy}(M)$ for every $a\in M$. Now consider the type $p(x,a)$ consisting of formulas in ${\rm tp}(a)$ together with the assertion $x\neq a$. Clearly $p(x,y)$ is in the standard system, since ${\rm tp}(a)$ is. So it suffices to argue that it is finitely realizable, but this follows trivially from the fact that $a$ is not definable. All the same machinery works for computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ In particular, computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$ have lots of automoprhisms. At a recent JAF meeting, we were chatting about automorphisms of computably saturated models with Roman Kossak and Michał Godziszewski, when the following cute question came up. Is it possible to have a countable computably saturated model $M$ of ${\rm ZFC}$ such that every automorphism of its natural numbers $\mathbb N^M$ extends to an automorphism of $M$? Note that $\mathbb N^M$ must be computably saturated because $M$ is, so it has many automorphisms. We thought about it some more with Corey Switzer and finally realized that this is not possible. My guess is that this is all folklore. Theorem Suppose $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is a countable computably saturated model, then there is an automorphism of $\mathbb N^M$ that does not extend to an automorphism of $M$. Proof: Fix any nonstandard natural number $a\in M$. The model $M$ thinks that there is a least number $a'$ above all numbers definable over $\mathbb N^M$ by formulas of length less than $a$. In particular, it must be the case that $a'$ is not definable from $a$ because $M$ is correct about satisfaction for standard formulas over $\mathbb N^M$ and $a$ was chosen to be nonstandard. Thus, there is an automorphism of $\mathbb N^M$ which fixes $a$ but moves $a'$. But this automorphism cannot extend to $M$ because over $M$ $a'$ is definable from $a$. The above result holds with $\mathbb N^M$ replaced by any computably saturated substructure of $M$ that is a set in $M$ because all the proof used was that $M$ has a satisfaction relation for $\mathbb N^M$. Another random question that came up in the discussion, curtesy of Corey, was whether a non-computably saturated model of ${\rm ZFC}$ can have its natural numbers be computably saturated. The answer is easily seen to be yes. Theorem: There is a model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ which is not computably saturated, but its natural numbers are computably saturated. Proof: Suppose $\bar M\models{\rm ZFC}+V={\rm HOD}$ (without getting into technicalities, $V={\rm HOD}$, the assertion that every set is hereditarily ordinal definable, says that $M$ has a definable well-ordering, and hence definable Skolem functions) is computably saturated. So $\mathbb N^{\bar M}$ is computably saturated as well. Now let $M={\rm Scl}(\mathbb N^{\bar M})$ be the Skolem closure in $\bar M$ of the set of its natural numbers. It is not difficult to see that $M$ cannot be computably saturated. Consider the type $p(x,\omega)$ (using the single parameter $\omega\in M$) asserting that $x$ is an ordinal and for every formula $\varphi(y,z)$ asserting that for every $n\in\omega$, if there is a unique $z$ such that $\varphi(n,z)$, then $x&gt;z$. Clearly $p(x,\omega)$ is computable and finitely realizable in $M$, but it is not realized by the definition of $M$. Roman Kossak claims, but I don't know the argument, that we can even construct such $M$ to be rigid (meaning that it would have no automorphisms), and hence very far from computably saturated. Thanks Kameryn Williams for pointing out the following result. Theorem: Suppose $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ is non-standard. Then $\mathbb N^M$ is computably saturated. Proof: By a classical theorem of Lachlan, having a full satisfaction class implies computable saturation {% cite Lachlan:fullSatisfactionClass %}. A full satisfaction class is the ${\rm PA}$ terminology for a truth predicate - a subset of the model consisting of Gödel codes of formulas (including non-standard formulas) satisfying Tarskian truth conditions. A truth predicate gives a coherent definition of what is true in the model including a truth interpretation for non-standard formulas. Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan showed a partial converse that a countable computably saturated model always has a full satisfaction class {% cite KotlarskiKrajewskiLachlan:fullSatisfactionClass %}. An excellent source on everything you need to know about computably saturated models of ${\rm PA}$ is Roman's and Jim Schmerl's book {% cite kossakschmerl:modelsofpa %}. Most results there generalize to computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$, but there is not one good definitive source for results on these models, although people including myself, Joel Hamkins and Michał have written papers about them. See for example, {% cite HamkinsYang:SatisfactionIsNotAbsolute %} and {% cite multiverse:gitmanhamkins %} for interesting constructions with computably saturated models of ${\rm ZFC}$.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Models of second-order arithmetic have two kinds of objects: numbers and sets of numbers, which we think of as the reals. A second-order arithmetic axiom system specifies general existence rules for real numbers. If a result from, say, analysis can be proved in some such system, then we have a bound on the kind of reals that must exist in order for it to hold. Indeed, most classical results in analysis don't just follows from, but are actually equivalent (over a weak base system) to one of a short list of main second-order arithmetic systems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of the strongest second-order arithmetic systems is &lt;em&gt;full second-order arithmetic&lt;/em&gt; ${\rm Z}_2$ which asserts that every second-order formula (with any number of set quantifiers) defines a set. We can augment ${\rm Z}_2$ with choice principles such as the choice scheme and the dependent choice scheme. The $\Sigma^1_n$-&lt;em&gt;choice scheme&lt;/em&gt; asserts for every $\Sigma^1_n$-formula $\varphi(n,X)$ that if for every $n$, there is a set $X$ witnessing $\varphi(n,X)$, then there is a single set $Z$ whose $n$-th slice $Z_n$ is a witness for $\varphi(n,X)$. The $\Sigma^1_n$-&lt;em&gt;dependent choice scheme&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every $\Sigma^1_n$-relation $\varphi(X,Y)$ without terminal nodes has an infinite branch: there is a set $Z$ such that $\varphi(Z_n,Z_{n+1})$ holds for all $n$. The system ${\rm Z}_2$ proves the $\Sigma^1_2$-choice scheme and the $\Sigma^1_2$-dependent choice scheme. The independence of $\Pi^1_2$-choice scheme from ${\rm Z}_2$ follows by taking a model of ${\rm Z}_2$ whose sets are the reals of the Feferman-Levy model of ${\rm ZF}$ in which every $\aleph_n^L$ is countable and $\aleph_\omega^L$ is the first uncountable cardinal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We construct a model of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm AC}_\omega$ whose reals give a model of ${\rm Z}_2$ together with the full choice scheme in which $\Pi^1_2$-dependent choice fails. This result was first proved by Kanovei in 1979 and published in Russian. It was rediscovered by Sy Friedman and myself with a slightly simplified proof.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Classes, from class forcing notions to elementary embeddings of the universe to inner models, play a fundamental role in modern set theory. But within first-order set theory we are limited to studying only definable classes and we cannot even express properties that necessitate quantifying over classes. Second-order set theory is a formal framework in which a model consists both of a collection of sets and a collection of classes (which are themselves collections of sets). In second-order set theory, we can study classes such as truth predicates, which can never be definable over a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, and properties that, for instance, quantify over all inner models. With this formal background we can develop a theory of class forcing that explains why and when class forcing behaves differently from set forcing. In this talk, I will discuss a hierarchy of second-order set theories, starting from the weak Gödel-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$ and going beyond the relatively strong Kelley-Morse theory ${\rm KM}$. I will give an overview of a number of interesting second-order set theoretic principles that arose out of recent work in this area, such as, class choice principles, transfinite recursion with classes, determinacy of games on the ordinals, and the class Fodor Principle. The study of where these principles fit in the hierarchy of second-order set theories should serve as the beginning of a reverse mathematics program that I hope this talk will encourage set theorists to take part in.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Second-order set theory is the set-theoretic cousin of the extensively studied field of second-order arithmetic. It is formalized in a two-sorted logic with separate objects for sets and classes. Second-order set theory removes the limitation imposed by ${\rm ZFC}$ of having to work only with definable collections, and allows us to formally consider interesting never definable classes such as truth predicates. With this formal background, we can study properties of class forcing and understand how and why it fails to share many of the nice properties of set forcing. In this talk, I will discuss the hierarchy of second-order set theories from Gödel-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$ to beyond Kelley-Morse theory ${\rm KM}$. Along the way, I will establish some unexpected connections between models of second-order set theories and models of ${\rm ZFC}$ without the powerset axiom. I will also introduce an incipient program of reverse mathematics of second-order set theory which aims to place in the hierarchy various natural class set-theoretic principles such as the class forcing theorem, transfinite recursion with classes, and determinacy of games on the ordinals.&lt;/p&gt;

Gitman, J. D. Hamkins, and A. Karagila, “Kelley-Morse set theory does not prove the class Fodor theorem,” &lt;i&gt;Submitted&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; is the assertion that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ defined on a stationary class $S$ is constant on a stationary subclass of $S$. This statement can be expressed in the usual second-order language of set theory, and the principle can therefore be sensibly considered in the context of any of the various second-order set-theoretic systems, such as Gödel-Bernays ${\rm GBC}$ set theory or Kelley-Morse ${\rm KM}$ set theory. Just as with the classical Fodor's lemma in first-order set theory, the class Fodor principle is equivalent, over a weak base theory, to the assertion that the class club filter is normal. We shall investigate the strength of the class Fodor principle and try to find its place within the natural hierarchy of second-order set theories. We shall also define and study weaker versions of the class Fodor principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one tries to prove the class Fodor principle by adapting one of the classical proofs of the first-order Fodor's lemma, then one inevitably finds oneself needing to appeal to a certain second-order class-choice principle, which goes beyond the axiom of choice and the global choice principle, but which is not available in Kelley-Morse set theory &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in one standard proof, we would want for a given ${\rm Ord}$-indexed sequence of non-stationary classes to be able to choose for each member of it a class club that it misses. This would be an instance of class-choice, since we seek to choose classes here, rather than sets. The class choice principle ${\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$, it turns out, is sufficient for us to make these choices, for this principle states that if every ordinal $\alpha$ admits a class $A$ witnessing a $\Pi^0_1$-assertion $\varphi(\alpha,A)$, allowing class parameters, then there is a single class $B\subseteq {\rm Ord}\times V$, whose slices $B_\alpha$ witness $\varphi(\alpha,B_\alpha)$; and the property of being a class club avoiding a given class is $\Pi^0_1$ expressible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the class Fodor principle, and consequently also the normality of the class club filter, is provable in the relatively weak second-order set theory ${\rm GBC}+{\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$. This theory is known to be weaker in consistency strength than the theory ${\rm GBC}+\Pi^1_1$-comprehension, which is itself strictly weaker in consistency strength than ${\rm KM}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But meanwhile, although the class choice principle is weak in consistency strength, it is not actually provable in ${\rm KM}$; indeed, even the weak fragment ${\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$ is not provable in ${\rm KM}$. Those results were proved several years ago by the first two authors &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, but they can now be seen as  consequences of the main result of this article. In light of that result, however, one should perhaps not have expected to be able to prove the class Fodor principle in ${\rm KM}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it follows similarly from arguments of the third author in &lt;a href=&quot;#karagila:Fodor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; that if $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal, then there is a forcing extension $V[G]$ with a symmetric submodel $M$ such that $V_\kappa^M=V_\kappa$, which implies that $\mathcal M=(V_\kappa,\in, V^M_{\kappa+1})$ is a model of Kelley-Morse, and in $\mathcal M$, the class Fodor principle fails in a very strong sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, adapting the ideas of &lt;a href=&quot;#karagila:Fodor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; to the second-order set-theoretic context and using similar methods as in  &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, we shall prove that every model of ${\rm KM}$ has an extension in which the class Fodor principle fails in that strong sense: there can be a class function $F:{\rm Ord}\to\omega$, which is not constant on any stationary class. In particular, in these models, the class club filter is not $\sigma$-closed: there is a class $B\subseteq\omega\times{\rm Ord}$, each of whose vertical slices $B_n$ contains a class club, but $\bigcap B_n$ is empty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;
Kelley-Morse set theory ${\rm KM}$, if consistent, does not prove the class Fodor principle. Indeed, if there is a model of ${\rm KM}$, then there is a model of ${\rm KM}$ with a class function $F:{\rm Ord}\to \omega$, which is not constant on any stationary class; in this model, therefore, the class club filter is not $\sigma$-closed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall also investigate various weak versions of the class Fodor principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For a cardinal $\kappa$, the &lt;em&gt;class $\kappa$-Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every class function $F:S\to\kappa$ defined on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on a stationary subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;class $&lt;{\rm Ord}$-Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; is the assertion that the $\kappa$-class Fodor principle holds for every cardinal $\kappa$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;bounded class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is bounded on a stationary subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;very weak class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on an unbounded subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall separate these principles as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: Suppose ${\rm KM}$ is consistent.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class Fodor principle fails, but the class $&lt;{\rm Ord}$-Fodor principle holds.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle fails, but the bounded class Fodor principle holds.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle holds, but the bounded class Fodor principle fails.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
${\rm GB}^-$ proves the very weak class Fodor principle.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we show that the class Fodor principle can neither be created nor destroyed by set forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;:
 The class Fodor principle is invariant by set forcing over models of ${\rm GBC}^-$. That is, it holds in an extension if and only if it holds in the ground model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let us conclude the introduction by mentioning the following easy negative instance of the class Fodor principle for certain ${\rm GBC}$ models. This argument seems to be a part of set-theoretic folklore. Namely, consider an $\omega$-standard model of ${\rm GBC}$ set theory $M$ having no $V_\kappa^M$ that is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$. A minimal transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}$, for example, has this property. Inside $M$, let $F(\kappa)$ be the least $n$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ fails to satisfy $\Sigma_n$-collection. This is a definable class function $F:{\rm Ord}^M\to\omega$ in $M$, but it cannot be constant on any stationary class in $M$, because by the reflection theorem there is a class club of cardinals $\kappa$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ satisfies $\Sigma_n$-collection.&lt;/p&gt;

Definition: For a cardinal $\kappa$, the class $\kappa$-Fodor principle asserts that every class function $F:S\to\kappa$ defined on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on a stationary subclass of $S$. The class $ is the assertion that the $\kappa$-class Fodor principle holds for every cardinal $\kappa$. The bounded class Fodor principle asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is bounded on a stationary subclass of $S$. The very weak class Fodor principle asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on an unbounded subclass of $S$. We shall separate these principles as follows. Theorem: Suppose ${\rm KM}$ is consistent. There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class Fodor principle fails, but the class $ There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle fails, but the bounded class Fodor principle holds. There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle holds, but the bounded class Fodor principle fails. ${\rm GB}^-$ proves the very weak class Fodor principle. Finally, we show that the class Fodor principle can neither be created nor destroyed by set forcing. Theorem: The class Fodor principle is invariant by set forcing over models of ${\rm GBC}^-$. That is, it holds in an extension if and only if it holds in the ground model. Let us conclude the introduction by mentioning the following easy negative instance of the class Fodor principle for certain ${\rm GBC}$ models. This argument seems to be a part of set-theoretic folklore. Namely, consider an $\omega$-standard model of ${\rm GBC}$ set theory $M$ having no $V_\kappa^M$ that is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$. A minimal transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}$, for example, has this property. Inside $M$, let $F(\kappa)$ be the least $n$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ fails to satisfy $\Sigma_n$-collection. This is a definable class function $F:{\rm Ord}^M\to\omega$ in $M$, but it cannot be constant on any stationary class in $M$, because by the reflection theorem there is a class club of cardinals $\kappa$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ satisfies $\Sigma_n$-collection.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Set Theory is the study of properties of sets, which are the building blocks of all mathematical objects. It is a fairly young discipline that, in the early 19th century, arose out of attempts by mathematicians to provide a formal foundation for their work. Building on pioneering work of Georg Cantor, mathematicians codified elementary properties of sets by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms ZFC, but establishing even such basic properties of sets as the size of the continuum from the ZFC axioms proved difficult. This was soon partially explained by Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which showed that no sufficiently complex axiomatic system can decide the truth of all assertions. Sophisticated techniques, such as forcing, developed by set theorists over the course of the 20th century showed that most interesting properties of sets are not decided by ZFC, so that we can equally well consider both ZFC augmented by such a  property or by its negation. At the same time, set theorists introduced a hierarchy of strong axiomatic systems extending ZFC that impose an elegant structure on the mathematical universe. If we believe that to each of these various axiomatic systems corresponds a mathematical universe satisfying them, then there is a multiverse of mathematical universes, each with its own version of mathematics. In this talk, I will give an overview of modern set theoretic research and argue that it leads naturally to the conception of set theory as the study of the multiverse of mathematical universes, and that this view in turn leads to fruitful avenues of mathematical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a talk at the ALPS Seminar, Virginia Commonwealth University , April 12, 2019.Slides</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A $\square(\kappa)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness</title><link href="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A $&amp;#92;square(&amp;#92;kappa)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness" /><published>2019-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;CodyGitmanLambieHanson:SquarePrinciple&quot;&gt;B. Cody, V. Gitman, and C. Lambie-Hanson, “A $\square(κ)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness,” &lt;i&gt;Submitted&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce and investigate an incompactness principle we call $\square_1(\kappa)$, which is closely related to $\square(\kappa)$ but is consistent with weak compactness. Let us begin by recalling the basic facts about $\square(\kappa)$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle $\square(\kappa)$ asserts that there is a $\kappa$-length coherent sequence of clubs $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ that cannot be threaded. For an uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a sequence $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ of clubs $C_\alpha\subseteq\alpha$ is called &lt;em&gt;coherent&lt;/em&gt; if whenever $\beta$ is a limit point of $C_\alpha$ we have $C_\beta=C_\alpha\cap\beta$. Given a coherent sequence $\vec{C}$, we say that $C$ is a &lt;em&gt;thread&lt;/em&gt; through $\vec{C}$ if $C$ is a club subset of $\kappa$ and $C\cap\alpha=C_\alpha$ for every limit point $\alpha$ of $C$. A coherent sequence $\vec{C}$ is called a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence if it cannot be threaded, and $\square(\kappa)$ holds if there is a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence. It is easy to see that $\square(\kappa)$ implies that $\kappa$ is not weakly compact, and thus $\square(\kappa)$ can be viewed as asserting that $\kappa$ exhibits a certain amount of incompactness. The principle $\square(\kappa)$ was isolated by Todorčević &lt;a href=&quot;#Todorcevic:squareKappa&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, building on work of Jensen &lt;a href=&quot;#Jensen:FineStructure&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, who showed that, if $V = L$, then $\square(\kappa)$ holds for every regular uncountable $\kappa$ that is not weakly compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The natural ${\leq}\kappa$-strategically closed forcing to add a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence (&lt;a href=&quot;#LambieHanson:SquaresAndCoveringMatrices&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, Lemma 35) preserves the inaccessibility as well as the Mahloness of $\kappa$, but kills the weak compactness of $\kappa$ and indeed adds a non-reflecting stationary set. However, if $\kappa$ is weakly compact, there is a forcing &lt;a href=&quot;#HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; which adds a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence and also preserves the fact that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ reflects. Thus, relative to the existence of a weakly compact cardinal, $\square(\kappa)$ is consistent with ${\rm Refl}(\kappa)$, the principle that every stationary set reflects. However, $\square(\kappa)$ implies the failure of the simultaneous stationary reflection principle ${\rm Refl}(\kappa,2)$ which states that if $S$ and $T$ are any two stationary subsets of $\kappa$, then there is some $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ with ${\rm cf}(\alpha)&gt;\omega$ such that $S\cap \alpha$ and $T\cap\alpha$ are both stationary in $\alpha$. In fact, $\square(\kappa)$ implies that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ can be partitioned into two stationary sets that do not simultaneously reflect (&lt;a href=&quot;#HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, Theorem 2.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, then the collection of non-$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $\kappa$ forms a natural normal ideal called the $\Pi^1_1$-indescribability ideal:
$$\Pi^1_1(\kappa)=\{X\subseteq\kappa\mid \text{$X$ is not $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable}\}.$$
A set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable&lt;/em&gt; if for every $A\subseteq V_\kappa$ and every $\Pi^1_1$-sentence $\varphi$, whenever $(V_\kappa,\in,A)\models\varphi$ there is an $\alpha\in S$ such that $(V_\alpha,\in,A\cap V_\alpha)\models\varphi$. More generally, a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal $\kappa$ carries the analogously defined $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal. It is natural to ask the question: which results concerning the nonstationary ideal can be generalized to the various ideals associated to large cardinals, such as the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideals? The work of Sun &lt;a href=&quot;#Sun:StationaryCardinals&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and Hellsten &lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:DiamondsOnLargeCardinals&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; showed that when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable the collection of \emph{$n$-club} subsets of $\kappa$ is a filter-base for the filter $\Pi^1_n(\kappa)^*$ dual to the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal, yielding a characterization of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets that resembles the definition of stationarity: when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable, a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable if and only if $S\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $n$-club $C\subseteq\kappa$. Several recent results have used this characterization (&lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:OrdersOfIndescribableSets&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:SaturationOfTheWeaklyCompactIdeal&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#CodySakai:WeaklyCompactAtLeastOmegaWeaklyCompact&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;) to generalize theorems concerning the nonstationary ideal to the $\Pi^1_1$-indescribability ideal. For technical reasons, there has been less success with the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideals for $n&gt;1$. In this article we continue this line of research: by replacing &quot;clubs&quot; with &quot;$1$-clubs&quot; we obtain a $\square(\kappa)$-like principle $\square_1(\kappa)$ that is consistent with weak compactness but not with $\Pi^1_2$-indescribability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will see that the principle $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds trivially at weakly compact cardinals $\kappa$ below which stationary reflection fails. (This is analogous to the fact that $\square(\kappa)$ holds trivially for every $\kappa$ of cofinality $\omega_1$.) Thus, the task at hand is not just to show that $\square_1(\kappa)$ is consistent with the weak compactness of $\kappa$, but to show that it is consistent with the weak compactness of $\kappa$ even when stationary reflection holds at many cardinals below $\kappa$, so that nontrivial coherence of the sequence is obtained. Recall that when $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact, the set of weakly compact cardinals below $\kappa$ is weakly compact and much more, so, in particular, the set of inaccessible $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ at which stationary reflection holds is weakly compact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt;
If $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\kappa$ remains $\kappa^+$-weakly compact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; and $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also investigate the relationship between $\square_1(\kappa)$ and weakly compact reflection principles. The &lt;em&gt;weakly compact reflection principle&lt;/em&gt; ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ states that $\kappa$ is weakly compact and for every weakly compact $S\subseteq \kappa$ there is an $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is weakly compact. It is straightforward to see that if $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable, then ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds, and if ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds, then $\kappa$ is $\omega$-weakly compact (see &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;). However, the following results show that neither of these implications can be reversed. The first author &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; showed that if ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds then there is a forcing which adds a non-reflecting weakly compact subset of $\kappa$ and preserves the $\omega$-weak compactness of $\kappa$, hence the $\omega$-weak compactness of $\kappa$ does not imply ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$. The first author and Hiroshi Sakai &lt;a href=&quot;#CodySakai:WeaklyCompactAtLeastOmegaWeaklyCompact&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; showed that ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ can hold at the least $\omega$-weakly compact cardinal, and hence ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ does not imply the $\Pi^1_2$-indescribability of $\kappa$. Just as $\square(\kappa)$ and ${\rm Refl}(\kappa)$ can hold simultaneously relative to a weakly compact cardinal, we will prove that $\square_1(\kappa)$ and ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ can hold simultaneously relative to a $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable cardinal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt;
Suppose that $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds. Then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Using $n$-club subsets of $\kappa$, we formulate a generalization of $\square_1(\kappa)$ to higher degrees of indescribability. It is easily seen that $\square_n(\kappa)$ implies that $\kappa$ is not $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-indescribable. However, for technical reasons  our methods do not seem to show that $\square_n(\kappa)$ can hold nontrivially when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable. Our methods do allow for a generalization of Hellsten's $1$-club shooting forcing to $n$-club shooting, and we also show that, if $S$ is a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable set, a $1$-club can be shot through
$S$ while preserving the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability of all $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable subsets of $S$.

Finally, we consider the influence of $\square_n(\kappa)$ on \emph{simultaneous} reflection of
$\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets. We let ${\rm Refl}_n(\kappa,\mu)$ denote the following simultaneous reflection principle: $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable and whenever $\{S_\alpha\mid\alpha&lt;\mu\}$ is a collection of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets, there is a $\beta&lt;\kappa$ such that $S_\alpha\cap\beta$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable for all $\alpha &lt; \mu$. We show that for $n\geq 1$, if $\square_n(\kappa)$ holds at a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal, then the simultaneous reflection principle ${\rm Refl}_n(\kappa,2)$ fails. As a consequence, we show that relative to a $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable cardinal, it is consistent that ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds and ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa,2)$ fails.

Our methods do allow for a generalization of Hellsten's $1$-club shooting forcing to $n$-club shooting, and we also show that, if $S$ is a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable set, a $1$-club can be shot through $S$ while preserving the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability of all $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable subsets of $S$. Finally, we consider the influence of $\square_n(\kappa)$ on \emph{simultaneous} reflection of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets. We let ${\rm Refl}_n(\kappa,\mu)$ denote the following simultaneous reflection principle: $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable and whenever $\{S_\alpha\mid\alphaReferences {% bibliography --cited %}</summary></entry></feed>
