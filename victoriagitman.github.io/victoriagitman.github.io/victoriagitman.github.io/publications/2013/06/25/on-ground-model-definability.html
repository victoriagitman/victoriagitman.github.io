Theorem 1: [Laver, Woodin] Suppose $V$ is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, $\mathbb P\in V$ is a forcing notion, and $G\subseteq\mathbb P$ is $V$-generic. Then in $V[G]$, the ground model $V$ is definable from the parameter $P(\gamma)^V$, where $\gamma=|\mathbb P|^V$.

There is a first-order formula which, using a ground model parameter, defines the ground model in any set-forcing extension. Before Theorem 1, properties of the forcing extension in relation to the ground model could be expressed in the forcing language using the predicate $\check V$ for the ground model sets.

In addition, Theorem 1 proved crucial to Woodin&#39;s pioneering work on suitable extender models, a potential approach to constructing the canonical inner model for a supercompact cardinal {% cite woodin:suitableextendermodels %}. In this article we investigate ground model definability for models of fragments of ${\rm ZFC}$, particularly of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and of ${\rm ZFC}^-$, and we obtain both positive and negative results. Laver&#39;s proof that ground models of ${\rm ZFC}$ are definable in their set-forcing extensions uses Hamkins&#39; techniques and results on pairs of models with the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties. Definition: [Hamkins] Suppose $V\subseteq W$ are transitive models of (some fragment of) ${\rm ZFC}$ with the same ordinals and $\delta$ is a cardinal in $W$. The pair $V\subseteq W$ satisfies the $\delta$-cover property if for every $A\in W$ with $A\subseteq V$ and $|A|^W&lt;\delta$, there is $B\in V$ with $A\subseteq B$ and $|B|^V&lt;\delta$. The pair $V\subseteq W$ satisfies the $\delta$-approximation property if whenever $A\in W$ with $A\subseteq V$ and $A\cap a\in V$ for every $a$ of size less than $\delta$ in $V$, then $A\in V$. Pairs of the form the ground model with its forcing extension, $V\subseteq V[G]$, satisfy the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for any regular $\delta\geq\gamma^+$, where $\gamma$ is the size of the forcing poset. This result is a weak version of the following more general theorem {% cite hamkins:coverandapproximations %}. Theorem 2: [Hamkins] Suppose $\delta$ is a cardinal and $\mathbb P$ is a poset which factors as $\mathbb R*\dot{\mathbb Q}$, where $\mathbb R$ is nontrivial (adds a new set) of size less than $\delta$ and $\vdash_{\mathbb R} \dot{\mathbb Q}$ is strategically $\lt\delta$-closed. Then the pair $V\subseteq V[G]$ satisfies the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for any forcing extension $V[G]$ by $\mathbb P$. «p&gt;strong&gt;Theorem 3&lt;/strong&gt; [Hamkins] Suppose $V$, $V’$ and $W$ are transitive models of ${\rm ZFC}$, $\delta$ is a regular cardinal in $W$, the pairs $V\subseteq W$ and $V’\subseteq W$ have the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties, $P(\delta)^V=P(\delta)^{V’}$, and $(\delta^+)^V=(\delta^+)^W$. Then $V=V’$.&lt;/p&gt; Laver&#39;s proof of Theorem 1 proceeds by combining the weak version of Theorem 2 with the uniqueness property of Theorem 3 as follows. A forcing extension $V[G]$ by a poset $\mathbb P$ of size $\gamma$ has the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for $\delta=\gamma^+$, and moreover it holds that $(\delta^+)^V=(\delta^+)^{V[G]}$. It is not difficult to see that there is an unbounded definable class $C$ of ordinals such that for every $\lambda\in C$, the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties reflect down to the pair $V_\lambda\subseteq V[G]_\lambda$, and moreover both $V_\lambda$ and $V[G]_\lambda$ satisfy a large enough fragment of ${\rm ZFC}$, call it ${\rm ZFC}^*$, for the proof of Theorem 3 to go through. Letting $s=P(\delta)^V$, the sets $V_\lambda$, for $\lambda\in C$, are then defined in $V[G]$ as the unique transitive models $M\models {\rm ZFC}^*$ of height $\lambda$, having $P(\delta)^M=s$ such that the pair $M\subseteq V[G]_\lambda$ has the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties. Finally, we can replace the parameter $s=P(\delta)^V$ with $P(\gamma)^V$ by observing that $P(\gamma)^V$ is definable from $P(\delta)^V$ in $V[G]$ with the help of the $\delta$-approximation property. Forcing constructions over models of ${\rm ZF}$ can be carried out in some overarching ${\rm ZFC}$ context because essential properties of forcing such as the definability of the forcing relation and the Truth Lemma do not require choice. Also, forcing over models of ${\rm ZF}$ preserves ${\rm ZF}$ to the forcing extension. Is every model of ${\rm ZF}$ definable in its set-forcing extensions? Although at the outset, it might appear that the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties machinery, used to prove definability ${\rm ZFC}$-ground models, isn&#39;t applicable to models without full choice, we will show that much of it can be salvaged with only a small fragment of choice. We prove an analogue of Theorem 3 for models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and derive from it a partial definability result for ground models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and forcing extensions by posets admitting a gap at $\delta$. Posets admitting a gap at $\delta$ are particularly suited to forcing over models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ because they also preserve ${\rm DC}_\delta$ to the forcing extension. Lévy introduced the dependent choice axiom variant ${\rm DC}_\delta$ asserting that for any nonempty set $S$ and any binary relation $R$, if for each sequence $s \in S^{\lt\delta}$ there is a $y\in S$ such that $s$ is $R$-related to $y$, then there is a function $f:\delta\to S$ such that $f\upharpoonright\alpha R f(\alpha)$ for each $\alpha&lt;\delta$. It is easy to see that ${\rm DC}_\delta$ implies the choice principle ${\rm AC}_\delta$, the assertion that indexed families $\{A_\xi\mid \xi&lt;\delta\}$ of nonempty sets have choice functions. The full ${\rm AC}$ is clearly equivalent to the assertion $\forall\delta \;{\rm DC}_\delta$, while ${\rm AC}_\delta$ is much weaker than ${\rm DC}_\delta$, as it provides choice functions only for already well-ordered families of nonempty sets. Indeed, for any fixed $\delta$, the principle ${\rm AC}_\delta$ does not imply ${\rm DC}_\omega$, while the assertion $\forall\delta {\rm AC}_\delta$ does imply ${\rm DC}_\omega$ but not ${\rm DC}_{\omega_1}$ {Jech1973:AxiomChoice]. Some of the natural models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ arise as symmetric inner models of forcing extensions and models of the form $L(V_{\delta+1})$. In [bibcite key=hamkins:gapforcing], Hamkins defined that a poset $\mathbb P$ admits a gap at a cardinal $\delta$ if it factors as $\mathbb R*\dot{\mathbb Q}$, where $\mathbb R$ is nontrivial forcing of size less than $\delta$, and it is forced by $\mathbb R$ that $\dot{\mathbb Q}$ is $\leq\delta$-strategically closed. By Theorem 2, a ${\rm ZFC}$ ground model with a forcing extension by a poset admitting a gap at a $\delta$ satisfy the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties. Indeed the analogous result for ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ holds as well. Main Theorem 1: Suppose $V$ is a model of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$, $\mathbb P\in V$ is a forcing notion admitting a gap at $\delta$, and $G\subseteq\mathbb P$ is $V$-generic. Then in $V[G]$, the ground model $V$ is definable from the parameter $P(\delta)^V$. Models of the theory ${\rm ZFC}^-$, known as set theory without powerset, are used widely throughout set theory. Typically, but not necessarily, these have a largest cardinal $\kappa$. The canonical ones are models $H_{\kappa^+}$, which are collections of all sets of hereditary size at most $\kappa$ for some cardinal $\kappa$. Models of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ also play a prominent role in the theory of smaller large cardinals, many of which, such as weakly compact, remarkable, unfoldable, and Ramsey cardinals, are characterized by the existence of elementary embeddings of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ models. Forcing over models of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ preserves ${\rm ZFC}^-$ to the forcing extension and the rest of standard forcing machinery carries over as well. However, we show that Laver&#39;s ground model definability result cannot be generalized to ${\rm ZFC}^-$ ground models. Using forcing, we produce a ${\rm ZFC}$ universe with a cardinal $\kappa$ such that ground model definability fails for $H_{\kappa^+}$. In this case, ground model definability is violated in the strongest possible sense because $H_{\kappa^+}$ has a set-forcing extension in which it is not definable even using a parameter from the extension. We can set up the preparatory forcing so that $\kappa$ is any ground model cardinal and so that the forcing extension violating ground model definability is by a poset of the form ${\rm Add}(\delta,1)$ for some regular cardinal $\delta&lt;\!&lt;\kappa$. It will follow from our arguments that there is always a countable transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ violating ground model definability. Main Theorem 2: Assume that $\delta, \kappa$ are cardinals such that $\delta$ is regular and either $2^{\lt\delta}\!&lt;\!\kappa$ or $\delta\!=\!\kappa\!=\!2^{\lt\kappa}$ holds. If $V[G]$ is a forcing extension by ${\rm Add}(\delta,\kappa^+)$, then $H_{\kappa^+}^{V[G]}$ is not definable in its forcing extension by ${\rm Add}(\delta,1)$. It follows that there is a countable transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}^-$ that is not definable in its Cohen forcing extension. References {% bibliography –cited %}" />

Some of the natural models of ${\\rm ZF}+{\\rm DC}_\\delta$ arise as symmetric inner models of forcing extensions and models of the form $L(V_{\\delta+1})$. In [bibcite key=hamkins:gapforcing], Hamkins defined that a poset $\\mathbb P$ admits a gap at a cardinal $\\delta$ if it factors as $\\mathbb R*\\dot{\\mathbb Q}$, where $\\mathbb R$ is nontrivial forcing of size less than $\\delta$, and it is forced by $\\mathbb R$ that $\\dot{\\mathbb Q}$ is $\\leq\\delta$-strategically closed. By Theorem 2, a ${\\rm ZFC}$ ground model with a forcing extension by a poset admitting a gap at a $\\delta$ satisfy the $\\delta$-cover and $\\delta$-approximation properties. Indeed the analogous result for ${\\rm ZF}+{\\rm DC}_\\delta$ holds as well. Main Theorem 1: Suppose $V$ is a model of ${\\rm ZF}+{\\rm DC}_\\delta$, $\\mathbb P\\in V$ is a forcing notion admitting a gap at $\\delta$, and $G\\subseteq\\mathbb P$ is $V$-generic. Then in $V[G]$, the ground model $V$ is definable from the parameter $P(\\delta)^V$. Models of the theory ${\\rm ZFC}^-$, known as set theory without powerset, are used widely throughout set theory. Typically, but not necessarily, these have a largest cardinal $\\kappa$. The canonical ones are models $H_{\\kappa^+}$, which are collections of all sets of hereditary size at most $\\kappa$ for some cardinal $\\kappa$. Models of ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ also play a prominent role in the theory of smaller large cardinals, many of which, such as weakly compact, remarkable, unfoldable, and Ramsey cardinals, are characterized by the existence of elementary embeddings of ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ models. Forcing over models of ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ preserves ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ to the forcing extension and the rest of standard forcing machinery carries over as well. However, we show that Laver&#39;s ground model definability result cannot be generalized to ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ ground models. Using forcing, we produce a ${\\rm ZFC}$ universe with a cardinal $\\kappa$ such that ground model definability fails for $H_{\\kappa^+}$. In this case, ground model definability is violated in the strongest possible sense because $H_{\\kappa^+}$ has a set-forcing extension in which it is not definable even using a parameter from the extension. We can set up the preparatory forcing so that $\\kappa$ is any ground model cardinal and so that the forcing extension violating ground model definability is by a poset of the form ${\\rm Add}(\\delta,1)$ for some regular cardinal $\\delta&lt;\\!&lt;\\kappa$. It will follow from our arguments that there is always a countable transitive model of ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ violating ground model definability. Main Theorem 2: Assume that $\\delta, \\kappa$ are cardinals such that $\\delta$ is regular and either $2^{\\lt\\delta}\\!&lt;\\!\\kappa$ or $\\delta\\!=\\!\\kappa\\!=\\!2^{\\lt\\kappa}$ holds. If $V[G]$ is a forcing extension by ${\\rm Add}(\\delta,\\kappa^+)$, then $H_{\\kappa^+}^{V[G]}$ is not definable in its forcing extension by ${\\rm Add}(\\delta,1)$. It follows that there is a countable transitive model of ${\\rm ZFC}^-$ that is not definable in its Cohen forcing extension.

<p>It took four decades since the invention of forcing for set theorists and to ask (and answer) what post factum seems as one of the most natural questions regarding forcing. Is the ground model a definable class of its set-forcing extensions? Laver published the positive answer in a paper mainly concerned with whether rank-into-rank cardinals can be created by small forcing <a href="#laver:groundmodel">[1]</a>. Woodin obtained the same result independently and it appeared in the appendix of <a href="#woodin:groundmodel">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> [Laver, Woodin] Suppose $V$ is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, $\mathbb P\in V$ is a forcing notion, and $G\subseteq\mathbb P$ is $V$-generic. Then in $V[G]$, the ground model $V$ is definable from the parameter $P(\gamma)^V$, where $\gamma=|\mathbb P|^V$.</p>

<p>Indeed, this definition of the ground model is uniform across all its set-forcing extensions. There is a first-order formula which, using a ground model parameter, defines the ground model in any set-forcing extension. Before Theorem 1, properties of the forcing extension in relation to the ground model could be expressed in the forcing language using the predicate $\check V$ for the ground model sets. But having a uniform definition of ground models in their set-forcing extensions was an immensely more powerful result that opened up rich new avenues of research. Hamkins and Reitz used it to introduce the <em>Ground Axiom</em>, a first-order assertion  that a universe is not a nontrivial set-forcing extension (missing reference). Research on the Ground Axiom in turn grew into the set-theoretic geology project that reverses the forcing construction by studying what remains from a model of set theory once the layers created by forcing are removed <a href="#FuchsHamkinsReitz:Set-theoreticGeology">[3]</a>.  Woodin made use of Theorem 1 in studying generic multiverses--collections of set-theoretic universes that are generated from a given universe by closing under generic extensions and ground models <a href="#woodin:groundmodel">[2]</a>. In addition, Theorem 1 proved crucial to Woodin's pioneering work on suitable extender models, a potential approach to constructing the canonical inner model for a supercompact cardinal <a href="#woodin:suitableextendermodels">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>In this article we investigate ground model definability for models of fragments of ${\rm ZFC}$, particularly of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and of ${\rm ZFC}^-$, and we obtain both positive and negative results.</p>

<p>Laver's proof that ground models of ${\rm ZFC}$ are definable in their set-forcing extensions uses Hamkins' techniques and results on pairs of models with the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> [Hamkins] Suppose $V\subseteq W$ are transitive models of (some fragment of) ${\rm ZFC}$ with the same ordinals and $\delta$ is a cardinal in $W$.
<ul>
<li>
The pair $V\subseteq W$ satisfies the $\delta$-<em>cover property</em> if for every $A\in W$ with $A\subseteq V$ and $|A|^W<\delta$, there is $B\in V$ with $A\subseteq B$ and $|B|^V<\delta$.
</li>
<li> The pair $V\subseteq W$ satisfies the $\delta$-<em>approximation property</em> if  whenever $A\in W$ with $A\subseteq V$ and $A\cap a\in V$ for every $a$ of size less than $\delta$ in $V$, then $A\in V$.
</li>
</ul>
Pairs of the form the ground model with its forcing extension, $V\subseteq V[G]$, satisfy the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for any regular $\delta\geq\gamma^+$, where $\gamma$ is the size of the forcing poset. This result is a weak version of the following more general theorem <a href="#hamkins:coverandapproximations">[5]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem 2:</strong> [Hamkins] Suppose  $\delta$ is a cardinal and $\mathbb P$ is a poset which factors as $\mathbb R*\dot{\mathbb Q}$, where $\mathbb R$ is nontrivial (adds a new set)  of size less than $\delta$ and $\vdash_{\mathbb R} \dot{\mathbb Q}$ is strategically $\lt\delta$-closed. Then the pair $V\subseteq V[G]$ satisfies the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for any forcing extension $V[G]$ by $\mathbb P$.</p>

<<p>strong>Theorem 3</strong> [Hamkins] Suppose $V$, $V'$ and $W$ are transitive  models of ${\rm ZFC}$, $\delta$ is a regular cardinal in $W$, the pairs $V\subseteq W$ and $V'\subseteq W$ have the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties, $P(\delta)^V=P(\delta)^{V'}$, and $(\delta^+)^V=(\delta^+)^W$. Then $V=V'$.</p>

<p>Laver's proof of Theorem 1 proceeds by combining the weak version of Theorem 2 with the uniqueness property of Theorem 3 as follows. A forcing extension $V[G]$ by a poset $\mathbb P$ of size $\gamma$ has the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties for $\delta=\gamma^+$, and moreover it holds that $(\delta^+)^V=(\delta^+)^{V[G]}$. It is not difficult to see that there is an unbounded definable class $C$ of ordinals such that for every $\lambda\in C$, the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties reflect down to the pair $V_\lambda\subseteq V[G]_\lambda$, and moreover both $V_\lambda$ and $V[G]_\lambda$ satisfy a large enough fragment of ${\rm ZFC}$, call it ${\rm ZFC}^*$, for the proof of Theorem 3 to go through. Letting $s=P(\delta)^V$, the sets $V_\lambda$, for $\lambda\in C$, are then defined in $V[G]$ as the unique transitive models $M\models {\rm ZFC}^*$ of height $\lambda$, having $P(\delta)^M=s$ such that  the pair $M\subseteq V[G]_\lambda$ has the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties. Finally,  we can replace the parameter $s=P(\delta)^V$ with $P(\gamma)^V$ by observing that $P(\gamma)^V$ is definable from $P(\delta)^V$ in $V[G]$ with the help of the $\delta$-approximation property.</p>

<p>Forcing constructions over models of ${\rm ZF}$ can be carried out in some overarching ${\rm ZFC}$ context because  essential properties of forcing such as the definability of the forcing relation and the Truth Lemma do not require choice. Also, forcing over models of ${\rm ZF}$ preserves ${\rm ZF}$ to the forcing extension. Is every model of ${\rm ZF}$ definable in its set-forcing extensions? Although at the outset, it might appear that the  $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties machinery, used to prove definability ${\rm ZFC}$-ground models, isn't applicable to models without full choice, we will show that much of it can be salvaged with only a small fragment of choice. We prove an analogue of Theorem 3  for models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and derive from it a partial definability result for ground models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ and forcing extensions by posets admitting a gap at $\delta$. Posets admitting a gap at $\delta$ are particularly suited to forcing over models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ because they also preserve ${\rm DC}_\delta$ to the forcing extension.</p>

<p>Lévy introduced the dependent choice axiom variant ${\rm DC}_\delta$ asserting that for any nonempty set $S$ and any binary relation $R$, if for each sequence $s \in S^{\lt\delta}$ there is a $y\in S$ such that $s$ is $R$-related to $y$, then there is a function $f:\delta\to S$ such that $f\upharpoonright\alpha R f(\alpha)$ for each $\alpha<\delta$. It is easy to see that ${\rm DC}_\delta$ implies the choice principle ${\rm AC}_\delta$, the assertion that indexed families $\{A_\xi\mid \xi<\delta\}$ of nonempty sets have choice functions. The full ${\rm AC}$  is clearly equivalent to the assertion $\forall\delta \;{\rm DC}_\delta$, while ${\rm AC}_\delta$ is much weaker than ${\rm DC}_\delta$, as it provides choice functions only for already well-ordered families of nonempty sets. Indeed, for any fixed $\delta$, the principle ${\rm AC}_\delta$ does not imply ${\rm DC}_\omega$, while the assertion $\forall\delta {\rm AC}_\delta$ does imply ${\rm DC}_\omega$ but not ${\rm DC}_{\omega_1}$ {Jech1973:AxiomChoice].  Some of the natural models of ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ arise as symmetric inner models of forcing extensions and models of the form $L(V_{\delta+1})$. In [bibcite key=hamkins:gapforcing], Hamkins defined that a poset $\mathbb P$ <em>admits a gap</em> at a cardinal $\delta$ if it factors as $\mathbb R*\dot{\mathbb Q}$, where $\mathbb R$ is nontrivial forcing of size less than $\delta$, and it is forced by $\mathbb R$ that $\dot{\mathbb Q}$ is $\leq\delta$-strategically closed. By Theorem 2, a ${\rm ZFC}$ ground model with a forcing extension by a poset admitting a gap at a $\delta$ satisfy the $\delta$-cover and $\delta$-approximation properties. Indeed the analogous result for ${\rm ZF}+{\rm DC}_\delta$ holds as well. </p>

<p>Models of the theory ${\rm ZFC}^-$, known as set theory without powerset, are used widely throughout set theory. Typically, but  not necessarily, these have a largest cardinal $\kappa$. The canonical ones are models $H_{\kappa^+}$, which are collections of all sets of hereditary size at most $\kappa$ for some cardinal $\kappa$.
