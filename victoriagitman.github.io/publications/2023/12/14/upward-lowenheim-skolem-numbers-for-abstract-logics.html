Niceness properties of strong logics have been shown to be connected to and often equivalent to the existence of large cardinals.

The upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem for first-order logic says that any infinite structure has arbitrarily large elementary superstructures. A very weak version of the upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem holds for all logics. Recall that the Hanf number of a logic $\mathcal L$ is the least cardinal $\delta$ such that for every language $\tau$ and $\mathcal L(\tau)$-sentence $\varphi$, if a $\tau$-structure $M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ has size $\gamma\geq\delta$, then for every cardinal $\overline\gamma&gt;\gamma$, there is a $\tau$-structure $\overline M$ of size at least $\overline\gamma$ such that $\overline M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$. The upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem implies, in particular, that the Hanf number of first-order logic is $\omega$. ${\rm ZFC}$ proves that every logic has a Hanf number (see, for instance, (see, for instance, {% cite Marker:InfinitaryModelTheory %}). Galeotti, Khomskii and Väänänen strengthened the notion of the Hanf number by requiring that the model $\overline M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ of size at least $\overline\gamma$ is a (not necessarily elementary) superstructure of $M$. Definition: ({% cite GaleottiKhomskiiVaananen:upwardLowenheimSkolem %}) Fix a logic $\mathcal L$. The upward Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number ${\rm ULST}(\mathcal L)$, if it exists, is the least cardinal $\delta$ such that for every language $\tau$ and $\mathcal L(\tau)$-sentence $\varphi$, if a $\tau$-structure $M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ has size $\gamma\geq\delta$, then for every cardinal $\overline\gamma&gt;\gamma$, there is a $\tau$-structure $\overline M$ of size at least $\overline\gamma$ such that $\overline M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ and $M\subseteq \overline M$ is a substructure of $\overline M$. The differences in the definitions of the Hanf and $\text{ULST}$ numbers mirror differences in notions of varying strengths generalizing the downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. The Löwenheim-Skolem number $\text{LS}(\mathcal L)$ of a logic $\mathcal L$ is the smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that any satisfiable sentence $\varphi$ of $\mathcal L$ has a model of size smaller than $\kappa$. Similar to the $\text{ULST}$ number, the Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number $\text{LST}(\mathcal L)$ adds the requirement, that any model of $\varphi$ has to have a substructure of size smaller than $\kappa$ satisfying $\varphi$. As with the Hanf number, it can be shown in ${\rm ZFC}$ that every logic has an $\text{LS}$ number. On the other hand, there is a long history going back to {%cite magidor:supercompact %} that shows that $\text{LST}$ numbers of logics can have large cardinal strength (see {% cite MagidorVaananen:LSTnumbers %}). Similar to this gain in strength that occurs when switching attention from $\text{LS}$ numbers to $\text{LST}$ numbers, Galeotti, Khomskii and Väänänen showed that the existence of the ${\rm ULST}$ number for second-order logic, ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$, implies the existence of very strong large cardinals. Theorem: ({% cite GaleottiKhomskiiVaananen:upwardLowenheimSkolem %}) If ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$ exists, then for every $n \in \omega$ there is an $n$-extendible cardinal $\lambda \leq {\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$. They further conjectured that the strength of the existence of ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$ is exactly that of an extendible cardinal. We positively answer their conjecture. Theorem: If ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$ exists, then it is the least extendible cardinal. We can further strengthen the notion of the ${\rm ULST}$ number to capture the full power of the upwards Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Definition: Fix a logic $\mathcal L$. The strong upward Löwenheim-Skolem number ${\rm SULST}(\mathcal L)$, if it exists, is the least cardinal $\delta$ such that for every language $\tau$ and every $\tau$-structure $M$ of size $\gamma\geq\delta$, for every cardinal $\overline\gamma &gt; \gamma$, there is a $\tau$-structure $\overline M$ of size at least $\overline\tau$ such that $M\prec_{\mathcal L} \overline M$ is an $\mathcal L$-elementary substructure of $\overline M$. Notice that we could equivalently define the strong upward Löwenheim-Skolem number analogously to the upward Löwenheim-Skolem number but preserving theories instead of single sentences.

Fix a logic $\mathcal L$. The <em>upward Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number</em> ${\rm ULST}(\mathcal L)$, if it exists, is the least cardinal $\delta$ such that for every language $\tau$ and $\mathcal L(\tau)$-sentence $\varphi$, if a $\tau$-structure $M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ has size $\gamma\geq\delta$, then for every cardinal $\overline\gamma>\gamma$, there is a $\tau$-structure $\overline M$ of size at least $\overline\gamma$ such that $\overline M\models_{\mathcal L}\varphi$ and $M\subseteq \overline M$ is a substructure of $\overline M$.

<p>
The differences in the definitions of the Hanf and $\text{ULST}$ numbers mirror differences in notions of varying strengths generalizing the <em>downward</em> Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. The <em>Löwenheim-Skolem</em> number $\text{LS}(\mathcal L)$ of a logic $\mathcal L$ is the smallest cardinal $\kappa$ such that any satisfiable sentence $\varphi$ of $\mathcal L$ has a model of size smaller than $\kappa$. Similar to the $\text{ULST}$ number, the Löwenheim-Skolem-<em>Tarski</em> number $\text{LST}(\mathcal L)$ adds the requirement, that any model of $\varphi$ has to have a substructure of size smaller than $\kappa$ satisfying $\varphi$. As with the Hanf number, it can be shown in ${\rm ZFC}$ that every logic has an $\text{LS}$ number. On the other hand, there is a long history going back to <a href="#magidor:supercompact">[3]</a> that shows that $\text{LST}$ numbers of logics can have large cardinal strength (see <a href="#MagidorVaananen:LSTnumbers">[4]</a>).
</p>

<p>Similar to this gain in strength that occurs when switching attention from $\text{LS}$ numbers to $\text{LST}$ numbers, Galeotti, Khomskii and Väänänen showed that the existence of the ${\rm ULST}$ number for second-order logic, ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$, implies the existence of very strong large cardinals.</p>

If ${\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$ exists, then for every $n \in  \omega$ there is an $n$-extendible cardinal $\lambda \leq {\rm ULST}(\mathbb L^2)$.
