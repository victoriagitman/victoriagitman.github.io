Stronger large cardinal axioms impose additional assumptions on the target model $M$ that allow it to capture more and more sets from $V$.

Suppose $\langle M,\in\rangle \models{\rm ZFC}^-$ is a transitive model of size $\kappa$ with $\kappa\in M$ (we will give precise definitions and drop the transitivity requirement in the next section). We call such structures weak $\kappa$-models. We will call a filter $U$, on the subsets of $\kappa$ of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$, an $M$-ultrafilter if the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$, together with a predicate for $U$, satisfies that $U$ is a uniform, normal ultrafilter on $\kappa$. What this says is that $U$ is an ultrafilter on the subsets of $\kappa$ that live in $M$ and if a $\kappa$-length sequence of elements of $U$ is an element of $M$, then its diagonal intersection is in $U$. The Łoś-Theorem holds for ultrapowers by an $M$-ultrafilter, but the ultrapower need not be well-founded. Note that the filter $U$ may not be countably complete for sequences outside of $M$. The $M$-ultrafilter $U$, is in most interesting cases, external to $M$ and even though $\langle M,\in\rangle\models{\rm ZFC}^-$, separation and replacement can fail completely in the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ once we let $M$ know about $U$. In the same way that making the inner model $M$ closer to $V$ in the characterizations of larger large cardinals increases strength, for the smaller large cardinals, we increase strength by making $M$ be more compatible with $U$, which amounts to $M$ being more correct about the properties of $U$ or to having more of the ${\rm ZFC}^-$ axioms in the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$. Let&#39;s look at some examples. A cardinal $\kappa$ is weakly compact if and only if it is inaccessible and every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a (externally) countably complete $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (in particular the ultrapower is well-founded). A cardinal $\kappa$ is completely ineffable if and only if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation (but with a potentially ill-founded ultrapower) {% cite HolyLucke:smallModels %}. A cardinal $\kappa$ is $1$-iterable if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in, U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation and the ultrapower is well-founded {% cite gitman:welch %}. A cardinal $\kappa$ is Ramsey if and only if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation and which is (externally) countably complete {% cite mitchell:ramsey %}. In this article, motivated by the work of Bovykin and McKenzie {% cite BovykinMcKenzie:RamseyLikeNFUM %}, we consider a hierarchy of large cardinal notions characterized by the existence, for weak $\kappa$-models $M$, of $M$-ultrafilters $U$ such that the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies fragments up to full ${\rm ZFC}^-$. Following Bovykin and McKenzie, we call such cardinals baby measurable. We show that increasing levels of replacement and separation for the structures $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ increases large cardinal strength even if the ultrapowers are ill-founded. For example, adding even $\Sigma_0$-replacement to the characterization of completely ineffable cardinals pushes consistency strength well beyond a Ramsey cardinal. We apply the concepts derived from baby measurable cardinals to Holy&#39;s and the second author&#39;s game Ramsey cardinals {% cite HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals %} to obtain strong small large cardinal notions below a measurable cardinal.

Measurable cardinals and most stronger large cardinals are defined by the existence of elementary embeddings $j:V\to M$ from the universe $V$ into an inner model $M$ with that cardinal as the critical point. Stronger large cardinal axioms impose additional assumptions on the target model $M$ that allow it to capture more and more sets from $V$. Weakly compact and many other smaller large cardinals are defined via combinatorial properties, often involving existence of large homogeneous sets for colorings. But almost all of them also have elementary embedding characterizations that, like the larger large cardinals, follow prescribed patterns as consistency strength grows. These smaller large cardinals $\kappa$ are characterized by elementary embeddings of models $\langle M,\in\rangle\models{\rm ZFC}^-$ of size $\kappa$, most often transitive, with critical point $\kappa$, and usually, but not always, with well-founded targets. ${\rm ZFC}^-$ is the theory ${\rm ZFC}$ with the powerset axiom removed, the collection scheme in place of the replacement scheme, and the version of the axiom of choice which states that every set can be well-ordered.(Without the powerset axiom, collection and replacement schemes are not equivalent and neither are the various forms of the axiom of choice. See <a href="#zarach:unions_of_zfminus_models">[1]</a> and <a href="#zfcminus:gitmanhamkinsjohnstone">[2]</a>.) In many cases, the existence of these embeddings can be equivalently expressed in terms of the existence of certain ultrafilters on the subsets of $\kappa$ contained in $M$.

Suppose $\langle M,\in\rangle \models{\rm ZFC}^-$ is a transitive model of size $\kappa$ with $\kappa\in M$ (we will give precise definitions and drop the transitivity requirement in the next section). We call such structures <em>weak $\kappa$-models</em>. We will call a filter $U$, on the subsets of $\kappa$ of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$, an <em>$M$-ultrafilter</em> if the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$, together with a predicate for $U$, satisfies that $U$ is a uniform, normal ultrafilter on $\kappa$. What this says is that $U$ is an ultrafilter on the subsets of $\kappa$ that live in $M$ and if a $\kappa$-length sequence of elements of $U$ is an element of $M$, then its diagonal intersection is in $U$. The Łoś-Theorem holds for ultrapowers by an $M$-ultrafilter, but the ultrapower need not be well-founded. Note that the filter $U$ may not be countably complete for sequences outside of $M$. The $M$-ultrafilter $U$, is in most interesting cases, external to $M$ and even though $\langle M,\in\rangle\models{\rm ZFC}^-$, separation and replacement can fail completely in the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ once we let $M$ know about $U$. In the same way that making the inner model $M$ closer to $V$ in the characterizations of larger large cardinals increases strength, for the smaller large cardinals, we increase strength by making $M$ be more compatible with $U$, which amounts to $M$ being more correct about the properties of $U$ or to having more of the ${\rm ZFC}^-$ axioms in the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$.

Let's look at some examples. A cardinal $\kappa$ is weakly compact if and only if it is inaccessible and every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is a (externally) countably complete $M$-ultrafilter $U$ (in particular the ultrapower is well-founded). A cardinal $\kappa$ is completely ineffable if and only if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation (but with a potentially ill-founded ultrapower) <a href="#HolyLucke:smallModels">[3]</a>. A cardinal $\kappa$ is $1$-iterable if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in, U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation and the ultrapower is well-founded <a href="#gitman:welch">[4]</a>. A cardinal $\kappa$ is Ramsey if and only if every $A\subseteq\kappa$ is an element of a weak $\kappa$-model $M$ for which there is an $M$-ultrafilter $U$ such that $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies $\Sigma_0$-separation and which is (externally) countably complete <a href="#mitchell:ramsey">[5]</a>.

In this article, motivated by the work of Bovykin and McKenzie <a href="#BovykinMcKenzie:RamseyLikeNFUM">[6]</a>, we consider a hierarchy of large cardinal notions characterized by the existence, for weak $\kappa$-models $M$, of $M$-ultrafilters $U$ such that the structure $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ satisfies fragments up to full ${\rm ZFC}^-$. Following Bovykin and McKenzie, we call such cardinals <em>baby measurable</em>. We show that increasing levels of replacement and separation for the structures $\langle M,\in,U\rangle$ increases large cardinal strength even if the ultrapowers are ill-founded. For example, adding even $\Sigma_0$-replacement to the characterization of completely ineffable cardinals pushes consistency strength well beyond a Ramsey cardinal. We apply the concepts derived from baby measurable cardinals to Holy's and the second author's game Ramsey cardinals <a href="#HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals">[7]</a> to obtain strong small large cardinal notions below a measurable cardinal. We show that these new large cardinals are robust under forcing. Finally, we show that these notions are naturally connected to models of Kelley-Morse set theory in which ${\rm Ord}$ is measurable and help us to understand the structure of these second-order models.
