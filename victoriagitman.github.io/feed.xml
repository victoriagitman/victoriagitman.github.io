&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Classes, from class forcing notions to elementary embeddings of the universe to inner models, play a fundamental role in modern set theory. But within first-order set theory we are limited to studying only definable classes and we cannot even express properties that necessitate quantifying over classes. Second-order set theory is a formal framework in which a model consists both of a collection of sets and a collection of classes (which are themselves collections of sets). In second-order set theory, we can study classes such as truth predicates, which can never be definable over a model of ${\rm ZFC}$, and properties that, for instance, quantify over all inner models. With this formal background we can develop a theory of class forcing that explains why and when class forcing behaves differently from set forcing. In this talk, I will discuss a hierarchy of second-order set theories, starting from the weak Gödel-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$ and going beyond the relatively strong Kelley-Morse theory ${\rm KM}$. I will give an overview of a number of interesting second-order set theoretic principles that arose out of recent work in this area, such as, class choice principles, transfinite recursion with classes, determinacy of games on the ordinals, and the class Fodor Principle. The study of where these principles fit in the hierarchy of second-order set theories should serve as the beginning of a reverse mathematics program that I hope this talk will encourage set theorists to take part in.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Second-order set theory is the set-theoretic cousin of the extensively studied field of second-order arithmetic. It is formalized in a two-sorted logic with separate objects for sets and classes. Second-order set theory removes the limitation imposed by ${\rm ZFC}$ of having to work only with definable collections, and allows us to formally consider interesting never definable classes such as truth predicates. With this formal background, we can study properties of class forcing and understand how and why it fails to share many of the nice properties of set forcing. In this talk, I will discuss the hierarchy of second-order set theories from Gödel-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$ to beyond Kelley-Morse theory ${\rm KM}$. Along the way, I will establish some unexpected connections between models of second-order set theories and models of ${\rm ZFC}$ without the powerset axiom. I will also introduce an incipient program of reverse mathematics of second-order set theory which aims to place in the hierarchy various natural class set-theoretic principles such as the class forcing theorem, transfinite recursion with classes, and determinacy of games on the ordinals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a talk at the special set theory session, Association for Symbolic Logic 2019 Annual North American Meeting, CUNY Graduate Center, May 20-23, 2019.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kelley-Morse set theory does not prove the class Fodor principle</title><link href="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/04/11/kelley-morse-theory-does-not-prove-the-class-fodor-principle.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kelley-Morse set theory does not prove the class Fodor principle" /><published>2019-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-04-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/04/11/kelley-morse-theory-does-not-prove-the-class-fodor-principle</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/04/11/kelley-morse-theory-does-not-prove-the-class-fodor-principle.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;GitmanHamkinsKaragila:KM-set-theory-does-not-prove-the-class-Fodor-theorem&quot;&gt;V. Gitman, J. D. Hamkins, and A. Karagila, “Kelley-Morse set theory does not prove the class Fodor theorem,” &lt;i&gt;Submitted&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; is the assertion that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ defined on a stationary class $S$ is constant on a stationary subclass of $S$. This statement can be expressed in the usual second-order language of set theory, and the principle can therefore be sensibly considered in the context of any of the various second-order set-theoretic systems, such as Gödel-Bernays ${\rm GBC}$ set theory or Kelley-Morse ${\rm KM}$ set theory. Just as with the classical Fodor's lemma in first-order set theory, the class Fodor principle is equivalent, over a weak base theory, to the assertion that the class club filter is normal. We shall investigate the strength of the class Fodor principle and try to find its place within the natural hierarchy of second-order set theories. We shall also define and study weaker versions of the class Fodor principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one tries to prove the class Fodor principle by adapting one of the classical proofs of the first-order Fodor's lemma, then one inevitably finds oneself needing to appeal to a certain second-order class-choice principle, which goes beyond the axiom of choice and the global choice principle, but which is not available in Kelley-Morse set theory &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in one standard proof, we would want for a given ${\rm Ord}$-indexed sequence of non-stationary classes to be able to choose for each member of it a class club that it misses. This would be an instance of class-choice, since we seek to choose classes here, rather than sets. The class choice principle ${\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$, it turns out, is sufficient for us to make these choices, for this principle states that if every ordinal $\alpha$ admits a class $A$ witnessing a $\Pi^0_1$-assertion $\varphi(\alpha,A)$, allowing class parameters, then there is a single class $B\subseteq {\rm Ord}\times V$, whose slices $B_\alpha$ witness $\varphi(\alpha,B_\alpha)$; and the property of being a class club avoiding a given class is $\Pi^0_1$ expressible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the class Fodor principle, and consequently also the normality of the class club filter, is provable in the relatively weak second-order set theory ${\rm GBC}+{\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$. This theory is known to be weaker in consistency strength than the theory ${\rm GBC}+\Pi^1_1$-comprehension, which is itself strictly weaker in consistency strength than ${\rm KM}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But meanwhile, although the class choice principle is weak in consistency strength, it is not actually provable in ${\rm KM}$; indeed, even the weak fragment ${\rm CC}(\Pi^0_1)$ is not provable in ${\rm KM}$. Those results were proved several years ago by the first two authors &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, but they can now be seen as  consequences of the main result of this article. In light of that result, however, one should perhaps not have expected to be able to prove the class Fodor principle in ${\rm KM}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it follows similarly from arguments of the third author in &lt;a href=&quot;#karagila:Fodor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; that if $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal, then there is a forcing extension $V[G]$ with a symmetric submodel $M$ such that $V_\kappa^M=V_\kappa$, which implies that $\mathcal M=(V_\kappa,\in, V^M_{\kappa+1})$ is a model of Kelley-Morse, and in $\mathcal M$, the class Fodor principle fails in a very strong sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, adapting the ideas of &lt;a href=&quot;#karagila:Fodor&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; to the second-order set-theoretic context and using similar methods as in  &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkins:KMplus&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, we shall prove that every model of ${\rm KM}$ has an extension in which the class Fodor principle fails in that strong sense: there can be a class function $F:{\rm Ord}\to\omega$, which is not constant on any stationary class. In particular, in these models, the class club filter is not $\sigma$-closed: there is a class $B\subseteq\omega\times{\rm Ord}$, each of whose vertical slices $B_n$ contains a class club, but $\bigcap B_n$ is empty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;
Kelley-Morse set theory ${\rm KM}$, if consistent, does not prove the class Fodor principle. Indeed, if there is a model of ${\rm KM}$, then there is a model of ${\rm KM}$ with a class function $F:{\rm Ord}\to \omega$, which is not constant on any stationary class; in this model, therefore, the class club filter is not $\sigma$-closed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall also investigate various weak versions of the class Fodor principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
For a cardinal $\kappa$, the &lt;em&gt;class $\kappa$-Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every class function $F:S\to\kappa$ defined on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on a stationary subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;class $&lt;{\rm Ord}$-Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; is the assertion that the $\kappa$-class Fodor principle holds for every cardinal $\kappa$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;bounded class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is bounded on a stationary subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;very weak class Fodor principle&lt;/em&gt; asserts that every regressive class function $F:S\to{\rm Ord}$ on a stationary class $S\subseteq{\rm Ord}$ is constant on an unbounded subclass of $S$.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall separate these principles as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;: Suppose ${\rm KM}$ is consistent.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class Fodor principle fails, but the class $&lt;{\rm Ord}$-Fodor principle holds.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle fails, but the bounded class Fodor principle holds.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
There is a model of ${\rm KM}$ in which the class $\omega$-Fodor principle holds, but the bounded class Fodor principle fails.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
${\rm GB}^-$ proves the very weak class Fodor principle.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we show that the class Fodor principle can neither be created nor destroyed by set forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem&lt;/strong&gt;:
 The class Fodor principle is invariant by set forcing over models of ${\rm GBC}^-$. That is, it holds in an extension if and only if it holds in the ground model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Let us conclude the introduction by mentioning the following easy negative instance of the class Fodor principle for certain ${\rm GBC}$ models. This argument seems to be a part of set-theoretic folklore. Namely, consider an $\omega$-standard model of ${\rm GBC}$ set theory $M$ having no $V_\kappa^M$ that is a model of ${\rm ZFC}$. A minimal transitive model of ${\rm ZFC}$, for example, has this property. Inside $M$, let $F(\kappa)$ be the least $n$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ fails to satisfy $\Sigma_n$-collection. This is a definable class function $F:{\rm Ord}^M\to\omega$ in $M$, but it cannot be constant on any stationary class in $M$, because by the reflection theorem there is a class club of cardinals $\kappa$ such that $V_\kappa^M$ satisfies $\Sigma_n$-collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Set Theory is the study of properties of sets, which are the building blocks of all mathematical objects. It is a fairly young discipline that, in the early 19th century, arose out of attempts by mathematicians to provide a formal foundation for their work. Building on pioneering work of Georg Cantor, mathematicians codified elementary properties of sets by the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms ZFC, but establishing even such basic properties of sets as the size of the continuum from the ZFC axioms proved difficult. This was soon partially explained by Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, which showed that no sufficiently complex axiomatic system can decide the truth of all assertions. Sophisticated techniques, such as forcing, developed by set theorists over the course of the 20th century showed that most interesting properties of sets are not decided by ZFC, so that we can equally well consider both ZFC augmented by such a  property or by its negation. At the same time, set theorists introduced a hierarchy of strong axiomatic systems extending ZFC that impose an elegant structure on the mathematical universe. If we believe that to each of these various axiomatic systems corresponds a mathematical universe satisfying them, then there is a multiverse of mathematical universes, each with its own version of mathematics. In this talk, I will give an overview of modern set theoretic research and argue that it leads naturally to the conception of set theory as the study of the multiverse of mathematical universes, and that this view in turn leads to fruitful avenues of mathematical research.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a talk at the ALPS Seminar, Virginia Commonwealth University , April 12, 2019.Slides</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A $\square(\kappa)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness</title><link href="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A $&amp;#92;square(&amp;#92;kappa)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness" /><published>2019-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://victoriagitman.github.io/publications/2019/02/09/square-like-principle-consistent-with-weak-compactness.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;CodyGitmanLambieHanson:SquarePrinciple&quot;&gt;B. Cody, V. Gitman, and C. Lambie-Hanson, “A $\square(κ)$-like principle consistent with weak compactness,” &lt;i&gt;Submitted&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we introduce and investigate an incompactness principle we call $\square_1(\kappa)$, which is closely related to $\square(\kappa)$ but is consistent with weak compactness. Let us begin by recalling the basic facts about $\square(\kappa)$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle $\square(\kappa)$ asserts that there is a $\kappa$-length coherent sequence of clubs $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ that cannot be threaded. For an uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a sequence $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ of clubs $C_\alpha\subseteq\alpha$ is called &lt;em&gt;coherent&lt;/em&gt; if whenever $\beta$ is a limit point of $C_\alpha$ we have $C_\beta=C_\alpha\cap\beta$. Given a coherent sequence $\vec{C}$, we say that $C$ is a &lt;em&gt;thread&lt;/em&gt; through $\vec{C}$ if $C$ is a club subset of $\kappa$ and $C\cap\alpha=C_\alpha$ for every limit point $\alpha$ of $C$. A coherent sequence $\vec{C}$ is called a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence if it cannot be threaded, and $\square(\kappa)$ holds if there is a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence. It is easy to see that $\square(\kappa)$ implies that $\kappa$ is not weakly compact, and thus $\square(\kappa)$ can be viewed as asserting that $\kappa$ exhibits a certain amount of incompactness. The principle $\square(\kappa)$ was isolated by Todorčević &lt;a href=&quot;#Todorcevic:squareKappa&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, building on work of Jensen &lt;a href=&quot;#Jensen:FineStructure&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, who showed that, if $V = L$, then $\square(\kappa)$ holds for every regular uncountable $\kappa$ that is not weakly compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The natural ${\leq}\kappa$-strategically closed forcing to add a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence (&lt;a href=&quot;#LambieHanson:SquaresAndCoveringMatrices&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, Lemma 35) preserves the inaccessibility as well as the Mahloness of $\kappa$, but kills the weak compactness of $\kappa$ and indeed adds a non-reflecting stationary set. However, if $\kappa$ is weakly compact, there is a forcing &lt;a href=&quot;#HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; which adds a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence and also preserves the fact that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ reflects. Thus, relative to the existence of a weakly compact cardinal, $\square(\kappa)$ is consistent with ${\rm Refl}(\kappa)$, the principle that every stationary set reflects. However, $\square(\kappa)$ implies the failure of the simultaneous stationary reflection principle ${\rm Refl}(\kappa,2)$ which states that if $S$ and $T$ are any two stationary subsets of $\kappa$, then there is some $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ with ${\rm cf}(\alpha)&gt;\omega$ such that $S\cap \alpha$ and $T\cap\alpha$ are both stationary in $\alpha$. In fact, $\square(\kappa)$ implies that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ can be partitioned into two stationary sets that do not simultaneously reflect (&lt;a href=&quot;#HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, Theorem 2.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, then the collection of non-$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $\kappa$ forms a natural normal ideal called the $\Pi^1_1$-indescribability ideal:
$$\Pi^1_1(\kappa)=\{X\subseteq\kappa\mid \text{$X$ is not $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable}\}.$$
A set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is &lt;em&gt;$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable&lt;/em&gt; if for every $A\subseteq V_\kappa$ and every $\Pi^1_1$-sentence $\varphi$, whenever $(V_\kappa,\in,A)\models\varphi$ there is an $\alpha\in S$ such that $(V_\alpha,\in,A\cap V_\alpha)\models\varphi$. More generally, a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal $\kappa$ carries the analogously defined $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal. It is natural to ask the question: which results concerning the nonstationary ideal can be generalized to the various ideals associated to large cardinals, such as the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideals? The work of Sun &lt;a href=&quot;#Sun:StationaryCardinals&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; and Hellsten &lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:DiamondsOnLargeCardinals&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; showed that when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable the collection of \emph{$n$-club} subsets of $\kappa$ is a filter-base for the filter $\Pi^1_n(\kappa)^*$ dual to the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal, yielding a characterization of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets that resembles the definition of stationarity: when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable, a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable if and only if $S\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $n$-club $C\subseteq\kappa$. Several recent results have used this characterization (&lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:OrdersOfIndescribableSets&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#Hellsten:SaturationOfTheWeaklyCompactIdeal&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#CodySakai:WeaklyCompactAtLeastOmegaWeaklyCompact&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;) to generalize theorems concerning the nonstationary ideal to the $\Pi^1_1$-indescribability ideal. For technical reasons, there has been less success with the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideals for $n&gt;1$. In this article we continue this line of research: by replacing &quot;clubs&quot; with &quot;$1$-clubs&quot; we obtain a $\square(\kappa)$-like principle $\square_1(\kappa)$ that is consistent with weak compactness but not with $\Pi^1_2$-indescribability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will see that the principle $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds trivially at weakly compact cardinals $\kappa$ below which stationary reflection fails. (This is analogous to the fact that $\square(\kappa)$ holds trivially for every $\kappa$ of cofinality $\omega_1$.) Thus, the task at hand is not just to show that $\square_1(\kappa)$ is consistent with the weak compactness of $\kappa$, but to show that it is consistent with the weak compactness of $\kappa$ even when stationary reflection holds at many cardinals below $\kappa$, so that nontrivial coherence of the sequence is obtained. Recall that when $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact, the set of weakly compact cardinals below $\kappa$ is weakly compact and much more, so, in particular, the set of inaccessible $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ at which stationary reflection holds is weakly compact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt;
If $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\kappa$ remains $\kappa^+$-weakly compact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; and $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also investigate the relationship between $\square_1(\kappa)$ and weakly compact reflection principles. The &lt;em&gt;weakly compact reflection principle&lt;/em&gt; ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ states that $\kappa$ is weakly compact and for every weakly compact $S\subseteq \kappa$ there is an $\alpha&lt;\kappa$ such that $S\cap\alpha$ is weakly compact. It is straightforward to see that if $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable, then ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds, and if ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds, then $\kappa$ is $\omega$-weakly compact (see &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;). However, the following results show that neither of these implications can be reversed. The first author &lt;a href=&quot;#Cody:AddingANonReflectingWeaklyCompactSet&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt; showed that if ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds then there is a forcing which adds a non-reflecting weakly compact subset of $\kappa$ and preserves the $\omega$-weak compactness of $\kappa$, hence the $\omega$-weak compactness of $\kappa$ does not imply ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$. The first author and Hiroshi Sakai &lt;a href=&quot;#CodySakai:WeaklyCompactAtLeastOmegaWeaklyCompact&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt; showed that ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ can hold at the least $\omega$-weakly compact cardinal, and hence ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ does not imply the $\Pi^1_2$-indescribability of $\kappa$. Just as $\square(\kappa)$ and ${\rm Refl}(\kappa)$ can hold simultaneously relative to a weakly compact cardinal, we will prove that $\square_1(\kappa)$ and ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ can hold simultaneously relative to a $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable cardinal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem:&lt;/strong&gt;
Suppose that $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds. Then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Using $n$-club subsets of $\kappa$, we formulate a generalization of $\square_1(\kappa)$ to higher degrees of indescribability. It is easily seen that $\square_n(\kappa)$ implies that $\kappa$ is not $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-indescribable. However, for technical reasons  our methods do not seem to show that $\square_n(\kappa)$ can hold nontrivially when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable. Our methods do allow for a generalization of Hellsten's $1$-club shooting forcing to $n$-club shooting, and we also show that, if $S$ is a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable set, a $1$-club can be shot through
$S$ while preserving the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability of all $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable subsets of $S$.

Finally, we consider the influence of $\square_n(\kappa)$ on \emph{simultaneous} reflection of
$\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets. We let ${\rm Refl}_n(\kappa,\mu)$ denote the following simultaneous reflection principle: $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable and whenever $\{S_\alpha\mid\alpha&lt;\mu\}$ is a collection of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets, there is a $\beta&lt;\kappa$ such that $S_\alpha\cap\beta$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable for all $\alpha &lt; \mu$. We show that for $n\geq 1$, if $\square_n(\kappa)$ holds at a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal, then the simultaneous reflection principle ${\rm Refl}_n(\kappa,2)$ fails. As a consequence, we show that relative to a $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable cardinal, it is consistent that ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ holds and ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa,2)$ fails.

Let us begin by recalling the basic facts about $\square(\kappa)$. The principle $\square(\kappa)$ asserts that there is a $\kappa$-length coherent sequence of clubs $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ that cannot be threaded. For an uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, a sequence $\vec{C}=\langle C_\alpha\mid\alpha\in\text{lim}(\kappa)\rangle$ of clubs $C_\alpha\subseteq\alpha$ is called coherent if whenever $\beta$ is a limit point of $C_\alpha$ we have $C_\beta=C_\alpha\cap\beta$. Given a coherent sequence $\vec{C}$, we say that $C$ is a thread through $\vec{C}$ if $C$ is a club subset of $\kappa$ and $C\cap\alpha=C_\alpha$ for every limit point $\alpha$ of $C$. A coherent sequence $\vec{C}$ is called a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence if it cannot be threaded, and $\square(\kappa)$ holds if there is a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence. It is easy to see that $\square(\kappa)$ implies that $\kappa$ is not weakly compact, and thus $\square(\kappa)$ can be viewed as asserting that $\kappa$ exhibits a certain amount of incompactness. The principle $\square(\kappa)$ was isolated by Todorčević {% cite Todorcevic:squareKappa %}, building on work of Jensen {% cite Jensen:FineStructure %}, who showed that, if $V = L$, then $\square(\kappa)$ holds for every regular uncountable $\kappa$ that is not weakly compact. The natural ${\leq}\kappa$-strategically closed forcing to add a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence ({% cite LambieHanson:SquaresAndCoveringMatrices %}, Lemma 35) preserves the inaccessibility as well as the Mahloness of $\kappa$, but kills the weak compactness of $\kappa$ and indeed adds a non-reflecting stationary set. However, if $\kappa$ is weakly compact, there is a forcing {% cite HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences %} which adds a $\square(\kappa)$-sequence and also preserves the fact that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ reflects. Thus, relative to the existence of a weakly compact cardinal, $\square(\kappa)$ is consistent with ${\rm Refl}(\kappa)$, the principle that every stationary set reflects. However, $\square(\kappa)$ implies the failure of the simultaneous stationary reflection principle ${\rm Refl}(\kappa,2)$ which states that if $S$ and $T$ are any two stationary subsets of $\kappa$, then there is some $\alpha\omega$ such that $S\cap \alpha$ and $T\cap\alpha$ are both stationary in $\alpha$. In fact, $\square(\kappa)$ implies that every stationary subset of $\kappa$ can be partitioned into two stationary sets that do not simultaneously reflect ({% cite HayutLambieHanson:SimultaneousStationaryReflectionAndSquareSequences %}, Theorem 2.1). If $\kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, then the collection of non-$\Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $\kappa$ forms a natural normal ideal called the $\Pi^1_1$-indescribability ideal: $$\Pi^1_1(\kappa)=\{X\subseteq\kappa\mid \text{$X$ is not $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable}\}.$$ A set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_1$-indescribable if for every $A\subseteq V_\kappa$ and every $\Pi^1_1$-sentence $\varphi$, whenever $(V_\kappa,\in,A)\models\varphi$ there is an $\alpha\in S$ such that $(V_\alpha,\in,A\cap V_\alpha)\models\varphi$. More generally, a $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable cardinal $\kappa$ carries the analogously defined $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal. It is natural to ask the question: which results concerning the nonstationary ideal can be generalized to the various ideals associated to large cardinals, such as the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideals? The work of Sun {% cite Sun:StationaryCardinals %} and Hellsten {% cite Hellsten:DiamondsOnLargeCardinals %} showed that when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable the collection of \emph{$n$-club} subsets of $\kappa$ is a filter-base for the filter $\Pi^1_n(\kappa)^*$ dual to the $\Pi^1_n$-indescribability ideal, yielding a characterization of $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable sets that resembles the definition of stationarity: when $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable, a set $S\subseteq\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_n$-indescribable if and only if $S\cap C\neq\emptyset$ for every $n$-club $C\subseteq\kappa$.

Recall that when $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact, the set of weakly compact cardinals below $\kappa$ is weakly compact and much more, so, in particular, the set of inaccessible $\alpha Theorem: If $\kappa$ is $\kappa^+$-weakly compact and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds, then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which $\kappa$ remains $\kappa^+$-weakly compact and $\square_1(\kappa)$ holds. We will also investigate the relationship between $\square_1(\kappa)$ and weakly compact reflection principles. The weakly compact reflection principle ${\rm Refl}_1(\kappa)$ states that $\kappa$ is weakly compact and for every weakly compact $S\subseteq \kappa$ there is an $\alpha Theorem: Suppose that $\kappa$ is $\Pi^1_2$-indescribable and the ${\rm GCH}$ holds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; Sy Friedman introduced an inner model, which he called the &lt;em&gt;stable core&lt;/em&gt;, in order to study under what circumstances the universe $V$ is a class forcing extension of ${\rm HOD}$. He showed there is a definable predicate $S$, amenable to ${\rm HOD}$, such that $V$ is a class forcing extension of the structure $\langle {\rm HOD},\in,S\rangle$. Namely, there is an ${\rm ORD}$-cc class partial order $\mathbb P$ definable in $\langle {\rm HOD},\in,S\rangle$ and a generic filter $G\subseteq \mathbb P$ such that ${\rm HOD}[G]=V$, however the filter $G$ itself is not definable over $V$. The predicate $S$, consisting of triples $(\alpha,\beta,n)$ for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ strong limit cardinals and $n\geq 1$ such that $H_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_n}H_\beta$ and $\Sigma_n$-collection holds in $H_\beta$, codes elementarity relations between nice enough initial segments $H_\alpha$ of $V$. Friedman's argument showed that the information necessary to define $\mathbb P$ is already contained in $S$ so that $V$ is already a class forcing extension of the stable core $\langle L[S],\in,S\rangle$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint work with Friedman and Sandra Müller, we investigated the properties of the stable core. We were interested to see whether the stable core is in any sense a canonical inner model, whether it has regularity properties, whether it is consistent with large cardinals, and whether we can code information into it using forcing. We showed that the stable core of $L[\mu]$, the canonical model for a single measurable cardinal, is $L[\mu]$ and therefore measurable cardinals are consistent with the stable core. By coding generic sets into the stable core over $L$ or $L[\mu]$, we showed that there is a generic extension of $L$ in which the ${\rm GCH}$ fails at every regular cardinal in the stable core and there is a generic extension of $L[\mu]$ in which there is a measurable cardinal which is not even weakly compact in the stable core. Our work leaves numerous open questions about the structure of the stable core in the presence of large cardinals beyond a measurable cardinal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sy Friedman introduced an inner model, which he called the &lt;em&gt;Stable Core&lt;/em&gt;, in the process of trying to understand how close the inner model ${\rm HOD}$ can be to the universe $V$ &lt;a href=&quot;#Friedman:stableCore&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;em&gt;inner model&lt;/em&gt; is a definable (possibly with parameters) transitive sub-model of the universe satisfying ${\rm ZF}({\rm C})$ and containing all the ordinals. It has long been the goal of the inner model theory program to construct a canonical inner model that is close to $V$ in the presence of very large large cardinals. Canonical inner models are built from the bottom up using absolute rules, and as a result of this construction process satisfy regularity properties, such as the ${\rm GCH}$ and $\square$, and are (generally) unaffected by enlargements of the universe via forcing. Each of these canonical inner models, for example, $L$, $K^{DJ}$, $L[U]$, are close to the universe $V$ in the absence of certain large cardinals, but are very far from a universe having those large cardinals. There are several ways in which we can request that an inner model is close to $V$. The inner model can have some form of covering, agree on large cardinals, or reach the universe $V$ by forcing, so that $V$ is a forcing extension of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical inner models ultimately attempt to generalize Gödel's constructible universe $L$, making it compatible with large cardinals. Another inner model introduced by Gödel, the collection ${\rm HOD}$ of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets, lacks the fine structure of the canonical inner models and therefore their absoluteness and regularity properties, but it makes up for it by being compatible with all known large cardinals and in fact all known set theoretic assertions. This is essentially because using coding any set or class can become ordinal definable in a forcing extension. Every set $A$ is coded by a set of ordinals because we can recover a set from its transitive closure, the transitive closure can be coded by a binary relation on some cardinal, which maps to it via the Mostowski collapse, and a set of pairs of ordinals can in turn be coded by a subset of the cardinal. Now given a subset $A$ of a cardinal $\kappa$, we use forcing to code it into the continuum pattern of the extension, thus making $A$ ordinal definable in the extension. Indeed, in this manner, we can code the entire universe $V$ into the continuum function of a class forcing extension, making $V$ be precisely the ${\rm HOD}$ of this extension $V[G]$ (this was apparently first shown by Roguski &lt;a href=&quot;#Roguski:HOD&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, the coding idea is due to McAloon). It follows that any universe is the ${\rm HOD}$ of some larger universe, so that ${\rm HOD}$ can satisfy any (believed to be) consistent set-theoretic assertion. It is known that ${\rm HOD}$ can be quite far from $V$. Cheng, Hamkins, and Friedman showed that it is consistent that every measurable cardinal is not even weakly compact in ${\rm HOD}$ and that there can be a supercompact cardinal that is not even weakly compact in ${\rm HOD}$ &lt;a href=&quot;#ChengFriedmanHamkins:LargeCardinalsNeedNotBeLargeInHOD&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Cummings, Friedman, and Golshani showed that it is also consistent that $(\alpha^+)^{\rm{HOD}}&lt;\alpha^+$ for every infinite cardinal $\alpha$ (missing reference). Woodin, however has conjectured that in the presence of very large large cardinals ${\rm HOD}$ will be much closer to $V$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In further trying to understand the relationship between ${\rm HOD}$ and $V$, Sy Friedman defined the ordinal definable &lt;em&gt;stability predicate&lt;/em&gt; $S$ and showed that $V$ is a forcing extension of the structure $({\rm HOD},S)$, ${\rm HOD}$ together with a predicate for $S$ &lt;a href=&quot;#Friedman:stableCore&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. The stability predicate $S$ codes the elementarity relations between initial segments $H_\alpha$ of $V$. It consists of triples $(\alpha,\beta,n)$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are strong limit cardinals such that $H_\alpha$ and $H_\beta$ satisfy $\Sigma_n$-Collection and $H_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_n}H_\beta$. More precisely, Friedman showed that in the structure $({\rm HOD}, S)$, there is a definable class partial order $\mathbb P$ for which there is a generic filter $G\subseteq \mathbb P$ such that ${\rm HOD}[G]=V$. The result is quite subtle in that even though $(V,G)\models{\rm ZFC}$, $G$ is not definable over $V$. Hamkins and Reitz later showed that it is consistent for $V$ to not be a class forcing extension of ${\rm HOD}$, so some additional information is indeed required to make $V$ a forcing extension of ${\rm HOD}$ &lt;a href=&quot;#HamkinsReitz:The-set-theoretic-universe-is-not-necessarily-a-forcing-extension-of-HOD&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedman's result showed that $V$ is already a class forcing extension of the structure $(L[S],S)$, which is the Stable Core of the title of the post. Because $S$ is ordinal definable, $L[S]\subseteq {\rm HOD}$, and Friedman showed that consistently $L[S]$ can be smaller than ${\rm HOD}$. It remained unknown whether the new inner model had any regularity properties or whether it was consistent with large cardinals. In a joint work with Sy Friedman and Sandra Müller we establish some further properties that are consistent with the Stable Core &lt;a href=&quot;#FriedmanGitmanMuller:StableCore&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We generalized the recent work of Kennedy, Magidor, and Väänänen on the model $L[{\rm Card}]$ &lt;a href=&quot;#KennedyMagidorVaananen:extendedLogics&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; to show that $K^{DJ}$ and $L[U]$ are always contained in the Stable Core. Recall that $K^{DJ}$ is the Dodd-Jensen core model below a measurable cardinal and $L[U]$ is the canonical inner model for one measurable cardinal. This shows, in particular, that the Stable Core of $L[U]$ is $L[U]$, so that the Stable Core can have a measurable cardinal. Same techniques, using Kunen's generalization of the $L[U]$ construction, can be used to show that the Stable Core can have a number of measurable cardinals. The next open question is whether the Stable Core can have a measurable limit of measurable cardinals. The question arises because Kennedy, Magidor, Väänänen and Welch (the result is still unpublished) showed that if the universe has a (little more than) a measurable limit of measurable cardinals, then $L[{\rm Card}]$ is a very simple model, in particular, it satisfies the ${\rm GCH}$ and has no measurable cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is relatively easy to code information into the Stable Core over canonical models ($L$, $K^{DJ}$, or $L[U]$) because we can use their definability inside the Stable Core to compare the changes we made to the elementarity relations between the $H_\alpha$ to the original relations. Using a coding along these lines, we show that any set which can be added generically to $L$ (or $L[U]$) can be coded into the Stable Core of a further forcing extension. From this it follows that the ${\rm GCH}$ can fail at every regular cardinal in the Stable Core, that ${\rm CH}$ can fail and Martin's Axiom can hold in the Stable Core, that any cardinal of $L$ can become countable in the Stable Core, etc. We also show that there is a forcing extension of $L[U]$ in which the measurable cardinal $\kappa$ remains measurable but $\kappa$ is not even weakly compact in the Stable Core. Thus, measurable cardinals are not downward absolute to the Stable Core. Because we don't know how to code information into the Stable Core over arbitrary models, these results leave open the general question about what does the Stable Core look like the presence of larger large cardinals such as a measurable limit of measurable cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open questions here are numerous! Here are a few. It is easy to see using coding that the ${\rm HOD}$ of ${\rm HOD}$ can be smaller than ${\rm HOD}$. Can the Stable Core of the Stable Core be smaller? Is there a bound on the large cardinals compatible with the Stable Core? Or are larger large cardinals downward absolute to the Stable Core? Is the Stable Core of $M_1$, the canonical model for one Woodin cardinal, $M_1$?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: A major segment of modern research in set theory focuses on the topics of forcing and large cardinals. Forcing, introduced by Cohen to show the independence of the Continuum Hypothesis, is a technique for building set-theoretic universes satisfying a desired list of properties. Large cardinal axioms are strong axioms positing the existence of very large infinite objects and (often) elementary embeddings between set-theoretic structures. These axioms form a hierarchy against which the strength of any set-theoretic assertion can be measured. Forcing and large cardinals  interact in a number of unexpected ways. In this talk, I will discuss a relatively new avenue of research involving the notion of virtual large cardinals. Given a large cardinal property $A$ characterized by the existence of elementary embeddings of first-order structures, we say that the property $A$ holds virtually if embeddings on structures from the universe $V$ characterizing $A$ exists in forcing extensions of $V$. Virtual large cardinals are much weaker than their original counterparts, for instance being compatible with the constructible universe $L$. This line of research leads naturally to considering a virtual version of Vopěnka's Principle, a large cardinal principle which has found applications in other branches of math. Virtual Vopěnka's Principle states that given a proper class of first-order structures in a common language, two of them must elementary embed in a forcing extension of $V$. I will discuss the consistency strength of the new principle, which like other virtual large cardinal principles, is compatible with $L$, and some open questions concerning stronger version of the principle, where we demand that the forcing extension in which the embeddings exist preserves a large initial segment of the universe. Parts of this work are joint with Bagaria, Schindler, and Hamkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two standard approaches to carrying out the forcing construction over a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ set theory: with partial orders or with complete Boolean algebras. The two approaches yield the same forcing extensions because every partial order densely embeds into a complete Boolean algebra, and when a partial order densely embeds into another partial order, the two have the same forcing extensions. Although the partial order construction can be viewed as more straightforward, the complete Boolean algebras approach offers some advantages. For instance, there are theorems about forcing which have no known proofs without the use of Boolean algebras. One such fundamental result is the Intermediate Model Theorem, which states that if a universe $V\models{\rm ZFC}$ and $W\models{\rm ZFC}$ is an intermediate model between $V$ and one of its set-forcing extensions, then $W$ is itself a forcing extension of $V$. The theorem makes a fundamental use of the Axiom of Choice, but a weaker version of it still holds for models of ${\rm ZF}$. If $V\models{\rm ZF}$ and $V[a]\models{\rm ZF}$, with $a\subseteq V$, is an intermediate model between $V$ and one of its set-forcing extensions, then $V[a]$ is itself a set-forcing extension of $V$. Grigorieff in &lt;a href=&quot;#Grigorieff:IntermediateModels&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; attributes the Intermediate Model Theorem to Solovay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard Boolean algebras approach is not available in the context of class forcing because most class partial orders cannot be densely embedded into a sufficiently complete class Boolean algebra. Set forcing uses complete Boolean algebras, those which have suprema for all their subsets, because completeness is required for assigning Boolean values to formulas in the forcing language.  With a class Boolean algebra, which has suprema for all its subsets, we can still define the Boolean values of atomic formulas, but the definition of Boolean values for existential formulas needs to take suprema of subclasses, meaning that we must require a Boolean algebra to have those in order to be able to construct the Boolean-valued model. However, as shown in &lt;a href=&quot;#PeterHolyRegulaKrapfPhilippLuckeAnaNjegomirPhilippSchlicht:classforcing1&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, a class Boolean algebra with a proper class antichain can never have this level of completeness. Thus, only ${\rm ORD}$-cc Boolean algebras (having set-sized antichains) can potentially have suprema for all their subclasses. Indeed, it is shown in &lt;a href=&quot;#PeterHolyRegulaKrapfPhilippLuckeAnaNjegomirPhilippSchlicht:classforcing1&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; that every ${\rm ORD}$-cc partial order densely embeds into a complete Boolean algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article we nevertheless show that the Boolean algebras approach to class forcing can be carried out in sufficiently strong second-order set theories, for example, the theory Kelley-Morse plus the Choice Scheme, using hyperclass Boolean completions. We apply the Boolean algebras approach to show that the ${\rm ZF}$-analogue of the Intermediate Model Theorem holds for models of Kelley-Morse plus the Choice Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us call an extension $\mathscr W$ of a model $\mathscr V$ of second-order set theory &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; if it is generated by the classes of $\mathscr V$ together with a single new class. In particular, every forcing extension of $\mathscr V$ is simple. We show that every simple intermediate model between a model of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ and one of its class forcing extensions is itself a forcing extension, so that the Intermediate Model Theorem holds for simple extensions. We also show that an intermediate model between a model of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ and one of its class forcing extensions need not be simple, and thus the Intermediate Model Theorem can fail. For models of ${\rm KM}$, the Intermediate Model Theorem can fail even where the forcing has the ${\rm ORD}$-cc because a model of ${\rm KM}$ and its forcing extension by ${\rm ORD}$-cc forcing can have non-simple intermediate models. We don't know whether this can happen for models of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$. Finally, we show that if an intermediate model $\mathscr W$ between a model $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ and its forcing extension $\mathscr V[G]$ has a definable global well-ordering of classes, and we have additionally that $\mathscr W$ is definable in $\mathscr [G]$, then $\mathscr W$ must be a simple extension of $\mathscr V$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two standard ways to do forcing: using partial orders or using complete Boolean algebras. Since every partial order densely embeds into a complete Boolean algebra and whenever two partial orders densely embed, they produce the same forcing extensions, the two approaches to forcing are essentially interchangeable. But meanwhile each approach offers distinct advantages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of new object we would like to have in the forcing extension dictates what the conditions in the partial order should be. If you would like to add a new real, make the partial order consist of finite binary sequences. If you would like to add a tree, make the partial order consist of small trees. It is usually clear how different conditions in the partial order alter the properties of the new object. The Boolean completion of the partial order breaks the direct connection between the properties of the object we would like to add and the conditions in the forcing, which is precisely why pretty much no one uses the Boolean algebras approach in forcing practice. The Boolean algebras approach however offers both philosophical and practical advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often speak of the forcing relation for a partial order being definable. But what does the forcing relation really mean when we are talking about forcing over the entire universe $V$ and not just some toy countable model? In this context it does not make sense to say that $p\Vdash\varphi$ means that whenever $p$ is an element of a generic filter $G$, then $V[G]\models\varphi$. On the other hand, the Boolean-valued model construction with a complete Boolean algebra makes sense without reference to any transitive set models. Indeed, using any ultrafilter $U$ on the Boolean algebra, we can turn the Boolean-valued model into a definable model $M\models{\rm ZFC}$ of the form $\bar V[G]$, a forcing extension of submodel $\bar V$, where $V$ elementarily embeds into $\bar V$. So that by passing from $V$ to $\bar V$, a model with the same theory, we get access to both the universe and its forcing extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are theorems about forcing which have no known proofs without the use of complete Boolean algebras. A fundamental result about forcing is the Intermediate Model Theorem, which states that every intermediate universe $W\models{\rm ZFC}$ between a universe $V$ and its forcing extension $V[G]$ is itself a forcing extension of $V$. Indeed, if $V[G]$ is a forcing extension by $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ is a Boolean completion of $\mathbb P$, then $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ has a complete subalgebra $\mathbb D$ such that $W=V[\mathbb D\cap G]$ is a forcing extension by $\mathbb D$. Grigorief in &lt;a href=&quot;#Grigorieff:IntermediateModels&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; attributes the Intermediate Model Theorem to Solovay. The theorem makes a fundamental use of the Axiom of Choice, but is true in a weaker form for models of ${\rm ZF}$. If $V[a]\models{\rm ZF}$ with $a\subseteq V$ is an intermediate universe between $V\models{\rm ZF}$ and its forcing extension $V[G]$, then $V[a]$ is a forcing extension of $V$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that has been said so far holds true for &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; partial orders. What about class partial orders? Analyzing the properties of class partial orders is best done in a second-order setting where we have objects for classes as well as sets. One of the weakest second-order theories is the Gödel-Bernays set theory ${\rm GBC}$, so let's take it for the moment as our second-order foundation. We will think of models of second-order set theory as triples $\mathscr V=\langle V,\in,\mathcal C\rangle$, where $V$ is the collection of sets and $\mathcal C$ is the collection of classes. If $\mathbb P\in\mathcal C$ is partial order and $G\subseteq \mathbb P$ is $\mathscr V$-generic, then the forcing extension $\mathscr V[G]=\langle V[G],\in,\mathcal C[G]\rangle$, where $V[G]$ is all interpretations of $\mathbb P$-names and $\mathcal C[G]$ is all interpretations of &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; $\mathbb P$-names, which are collections of pairs $\langle \sigma,p\rangle$ where $\sigma$ is a $\mathbb P$-name and $p\in\mathbb P$. Now we can talk about the properties of class partial orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of forcing, class partial orders don't behave anywhere as nicely as set partial orders. Class partial orders may not preserve ${\rm GBC}$. Think for example, of the partial order to add bijection from $\omega$ onto ${\rm ORD}$. The forcing relation for a class partial order may not be definable because it can, for instance, code in a truth predicate for $\mathscr V$. Two class partial orders can densely embed but produce different forcing extensions. Class partial orders may not have Boolean completions. (The results are from &lt;a href=&quot;#PeterHolyRegulaKrapfPhilippSchlicht:classforcing2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;) To understand this last point, let's be more precise about the kind of Boolean completion we would like a class partial order to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The completeness of a Boolean algebra is used in defining the Boolean values of formulas in the forcing language. Suppose $\mathbb B$ is a Boolean algebra. For example, the Boolean value of an atomic assertion $$[[\sigma\in \tau]]=\bigwedge_{\langle \mu,b\rangle\in \tau}[[\sigma=\mu]]\cdot b$$ and the Boolean value of an existential assertion $$[[\exists x\varphi(x,\tau)]]=\bigvee_{\sigma\in V^{\mathbb B}}[[\varphi(\sigma,\tau)]].$$ So if $\mathbb B$ is class, then the definition of Boolean values for atomic assertions requires the existence suprema for sets (set-completeness), but the existential assertions require the existence of suprema for classes as well (class-completeness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class partial order can be densely embedded into a set-complete Boolean algebra if and only if its forcing relation is definable &lt;a href=&quot;#PeterHolyRegulaKrapfPhilippLuckeAnaNjegomirPhilippSchlicht:classforcing1&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. So in ${\rm GBC}$, it is not the case that every class partial order can be embedded into a set-complete Boolean algebra. To define the forcing relation however requires only a bit more comprehension, already in ${\rm GBC}$ together with $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension (for assertions with a single class quantifier) every class partial order has a definable forcing relation (indeed this is already true for a much weaker theory ${\rm GBC}+{\rm ETR}_{\rm {ORD}}$, see &lt;a href=&quot;#GitmanHamkinsHolySchlichtWilliams:ForcingTheorem&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;). So in the much stronger theory Kelley-Morse ${\rm KM}$ (which consists of ${\rm GBC}$ together with comprehension for all second-order assertions) every class partial order can be embedded into a set-complete Boolean algebra. But indeed, it will never be possible to embed every class partial order into a class-complete Boolean algebra. A Boolean algebra with a proper class antichain can never be class complete, and therefore no class partial order with a proper class antichain can be embedded into such a Boolean algebra &lt;a href=&quot;#PeterHolyRegulaKrapfPhilippLuckeAnaNjegomirPhilippSchlicht:classforcing1&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. But without class completeness, we cannot define the Boolean-valued model!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we try to carry out the standard Boolean completion construction with a class partial order? The elements of the completion are subsets of $\mathbb P$ that are regular cuts (a &lt;em&gt;cut&lt;/em&gt; is subset of $\mathbb P$ that is closed downwards and a cut $U$ is &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; if whenever $p\notin U$, then there is $q\leq p$ such that $U_q\cap U=\emptyset$, where $U_q$ is the cut consisting of all conditions in the cone below $p$). If $\mathbb P$ is a class, then regular cuts are definable sub-classes of $\mathbb P$, and so the collection of regular cuts of $\mathbb P$ is a &lt;em&gt;hyperclass&lt;/em&gt; - a (second-order) definable collection of classes. What properties does this hyperclass, call it $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$, have? We can definably impose a Boolean operations structure on it in the usual way, so it is a Boolean algebra. How complete is it? First, let's explain how some hyperclasses can actually be quite small, namely class-sized. We will say that a hyperclass, given a formula $\varphi(X,A)$, is &lt;em&gt;coded&lt;/em&gt; by a class $S$ if the classes satisfying $\varphi(X,A)$ are precisely the slices of $S$, where a class $T$ is a slice of $S$ if there is a set $a$ such that $T=\{y\mid \langle y,a\rangle\in S\}$. We should think of coded hyperclasses as being class-sized. The hyperclass Boolean algebra $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ is class-complete in the sense that it is complete for all coded hyperclasses. Given a hyperclass coded by $S$, its join is the least regular cut containing the union of all slices $S_a$. But because the elements of $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ are now classes, it should be intuitively clear that to have any hope of using it to define a Boolean-valued model, we need $\mathbb B_{\mathbb  P}$ to be complete for all hyperclasses, not just the coded ones. Remarkably it turns out that given any partial order $\mathbb P$ with a proper class antichain, if $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ is hyperclass complete, then we have comprehension for all second-order assertions, and therefore ${\rm KM}$ holds &lt;a href=&quot;#AntosFriedmanGitman:booleanclassforcing&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the completeness of the hyperclass object is directly connected to the amount of comprehension a model satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In models of ${\rm KM}$, the hyperclass object $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ has all the desired properties. It is complete for all hyperclasses and indeed, as aught to be the case because it has a class-sized dense sub-partial-order, all its hyperclass antichains are coded. But it is still very difficult if not impossible to define the Boolean-valued model with a Boolean algebra whose elements are classes. A natural solution to this problem is to move a slightly stronger second-order set theory Kelley-Morse together with the Choice Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Choice Scheme&lt;/em&gt; ${\rm CC}$ is a choice principle (or a collection principle depending on the point of view) for classes which states for every second-order assertion $\varphi(x,X,A)$ that if for every set $x$, there is a witnessing class $X$ such that $\varphi(x,X,A)$ holds, then there is a single class $Y$ collecting witnesses for every set $x$, in the sense that $\varphi(x,Y_x,A)$ holds for every set $x$ (where $Y_x$ is the $x$-th slice of $Y$ defined as above). Kelley-Morse does not prove even the weakest instances of the Choice Scheme, those for first-order assertions and making just $\omega$-many choices (missing reference). But nevertheless the two theories ${\rm KM}$ and ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ are equiconsistent, basically because the &quot;constructible universe&quot; of a model of ${\rm KM}$ satisfies ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$. The theory ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ has one remarkable feature. It is bi-interpretable with a very well-understood first-order set theory. Given a model $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ we can consider its class well-founded relations. For instance, $\mathscr V$ has relations coding ${\rm ORD}+{\rm ORD}$, ${\rm ORD}\times\omega$, $V\cup{\{V\}}$, etc. We can view such relations as coding transitive sets that sit &quot;above&quot; the sets of $V$. Modulo isomorphism, we can define a membership relation on the equivalence classes of these relations resulting in a first-order structure extending $V$. We will call this structure the companion model $M_{\mathscr V}$ of $\mathscr V$. The model $M_{\mathscr V}$ satisfies the theory ${\rm ZFC}^-_I$, consisting of the axioms of ${\rm ZFC}$ without powerset $(-)$, with the assertion that there is a largest cardinal $\kappa$ which is inaccessible ($I$). Natural models of ${\rm ZFC}^-_I$ are $H_{\kappa^+}$ for an inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$. The $V_\kappa$ of $M_{\mathscr V}$ consists of the sets $V$ of $\mathscr V$ and the subsets of $V_\kappa$ are the classes of $\mathscr V$. In the other direction if $M\models{\rm ZFC}^-_I$, then $\mathscr V=\langle V_\kappa^M,\in,\mathcal C\rangle$, where $\mathcal C$ consists of the subsets of $V_\kappa$ in $M$, is a model of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ whose companion model $M_{\mathscr V}$ is isomorphic to $M$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, whenever we work in a model $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$, we might as well be working in its companion model $M_{\mathscr V}$. But now the trick is that in $M_{\mathscr V}$, the class partial order $\mathbb P$ is a set (subset of $V_\kappa^{M_{\mathscr V}}$) and the hyperclass $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$ is a class-complete Boolean algebra with set-sized antichains. In $M_{\mathscr V}$, it is now easy to define the collection $M_{\mathscr V}^{\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}}$ of $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$-names as well the Boolean values of all assertions in the forcing language, using the completeness of $\mathbb B_{\mathbb P}$. In this sense, we have the Boolean algebras approach to forcing in models of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this is that we get the ${\rm ZF}$-analogue of the Intermediate Model Theorem for models of ${\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$. Let us say that $\mathscr W$ is a &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt; extension of $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ if $\mathscr W$ is generated by the classes of $\mathscr V$ together with a single class. In particular, forcing extensions of $\mathscr V$ are simple. Using, the Boolean-valued model, we can show that every intermediate simple extension $\mathscr W\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ between a model $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ and its forcing extension $\mathscr V[G]\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ is itself a forcing extension of $\mathscr V$. The result is optimal because it is possible to have intermediate models between a model $\mathscr V\models{\rm KM}+{\rm CC}$ and its forcing extension $\mathscr V[G]\models\rm KM+{\rm CC}$ that are not simple, and therefore cannot be forcing extensions themselves. &lt;a href=&quot;#AntosFriedmanGitman:booleanclassforcing&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
