To paraphrase Roman Kossak, $\omega_1$-like  models bridge the gap between countable and uncountable structures. A model $\mathcal M=\langle M,+,\cdot,&lt;,0,1\rangle$ of ${\rm PA}$ is $\omega_1$-<em>like</em> if it has size $\omega_1$, but all its proper $&lt;$-initial segments are countable. A model $\mathcal M=\langle M,\in\rangle$ of ${\rm ZFC}$ is $\omega_1$-<em>like</em> if it has size $\omega_1$, but all its rank initial segments $V_\alpha^{\mathcal M}$ are countable. Because the $\omega_1$-like models are locally countably one could naively imagine that theorems about countable models would generalize to $\omega_1$-like models. Indeed, it is nearly always the opposite that is the case. The entire set theoretic baggage of $\omega_1$ gets implicitly built into an $\omega_1$-like model. Suddenly the techniques of clubs, stationary sets, reflection, the $\diamondsuit$-principle, etc. can be applied to modifying and controlling purely model theoretic properties. If you want to violate a fundamental theorem about countable models in an uncountable case, your best bet is usually an $\omega_1$-like model. Alternatively, if you seek an uncountable model with some property that becomes interesting only in the uncountable context, again $\omega_1$-like models are usually the way to go. Let's mention a few notable $\omega_1$-like models.

<p>First some positive constructions. A model of cardinality $\kappa$ is <em>Jónsson</em> if it has no proper elementary substructures of cardinality $\kappa$. Julia Knight showed that there is a Jónsson $\omega_1$-like model of ${\rm ZFC}$ (or ${\rm PA}$) <a href="#knight:hanfnumbers">[1]</a>. Ali Enayat calls a model <em>Leibnizian</em> if it has no indiscernibles, that is, every element has a unique type. This is meant to recall Leibniz who postulated the <em>Identity of Indiscernibles</em> principle stating that no two distinct objects should share all the same properties. It is not difficult to construct countable Leibnizian models because any point-wise definable countable model is Leibnizian. Enayat showed that there is an $\omega_1$-like Leibnizian model of ${\rm ZFC}$ and it is still open whether one can have a Leibnizian model of size continuum if ${\rm CH}$ fails <a href="#enayat:jonsson">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Now to the counterexamples. An <em>end-extension</em> of a model of ${\rm ZFC}$ adds only new elements of higher rank than all ordinals of the original model. By a classical theorem of Keisler and Morley, every countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$ has an elementary end-extension <a href="#keislermorley:topextensions">[3]</a>. But Kaufmann showed that there is an $\omega_1$-like model of ${\rm ZFC}$ that doesn't have an elementary end-extension [bibcite key=kaufmann:omega1likemodels]. An elegant result from models of ${\rm PA}$ is the complete classification of countable computably saturated models using two invariants: theory and standard system. The standard system ${\rm SSy}(\mathcal M)$ of $\mathcal M\models{\rm PA}$ is the collection of subsets of $\mathbb N$ that arise as intersections of its initial segment $\mathbb N$ with definable subsets of $\mathcal M$. Two countable recursively saturated models of ${\rm PA}$ are isomorphic if and only if they share the same theory and standard system. The $\omega_1$-like models have a counterexample. Kossak constructed two recursively saturated $\omega_1$-like models with the same theory and standard system such that neither embeds into the other <a href="#kossak:recusively_saturated_omega_1-like_models">[4]</a>. This talk is about another counterexample in the class of $\omega_1$-like models to a theorem about countable models.

<p>Hamkins showed recently that given any two countable models of ${\rm ZFC}$ one of them embeds into the other <a href="#Hamkins:EveryCountableModelOfSetTheoryEmbedsIntoItsOwnL">[5]</a>. Indeed, whether a countable model of ${\rm ZFC}$ embeds into another countable model is completely determined by whether its ordinals embed. The intuition from the very beginning was that the result would fail for $\omega_1$-like models. In a joint work with Gunter Fuchs and Joel Hamkins, we show that <a href="#fuchsgitmanhamkins:omega1models">[6]</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Assuming $\diamondsuit$, if ${\rm ZFC}$ is consistent, then there is a collection $\mathcal C$ of the maximum possible size $2^{\omega_1}$ of $\omega_1$-like models of ${\rm ZFC}$ such that there is no embedding between any pair of models in $\mathcal C$.</p>
